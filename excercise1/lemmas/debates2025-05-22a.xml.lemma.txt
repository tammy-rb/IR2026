the year dance can empower people from all background but third of school be not teach it despite its be on the national curriculum varied high quality sport offer should not be only for privileged few what step be the government take to ensure that all school can inspire their student through dance think my hon friend ask what step be take to promote dance well it take two to tango and we be work with the department for education to try to ensure that creative education be really important part of everything we do in all our school the fact that few kid be now study creative subject be problem and we need to rectify it hear the minister mention this in pass but would he not concede that the voluntary grassroots music levy be not make the progress we have all hop for the music venue trust have reveal that almost of arena and stadium show do not have any levy at all we need that income to rejuvenate grassroots venue the minister know that surely it be now time to think of formal levy and even legislation if require have say that we will make the levy statutory if we need to do so but we be make progress have want we to have make substantial progress by the first quarter of this year the levy have already be apply to half million ticket and want to get to much big number by the end of the year the culture media and sport committee do really good job in come up with the idea and we be determined to push it forward if the hon member could be less grumpy that would help if he could ring everybody he know in the industry and persuade they to sign up to the levy that would be great as this labour government deliver national youth strategy and open network of young futures hub what assurance will the minister give that the department will learn from the good practice of charity such as the thirst youth café and futurehope in my constituency will she join to meet they and find out more about how they deliver for young people in hertford and stortford the

national youth strategy and if my diary allow will be delighted to visit will enter the great parliamentary ice cream competition and say that cheshire of course do the good ice cream give the huge rich in the premier league should there not be great expectation that more money flow down into grassroots football and non league club such as knutsford fc and witton albion in my constituency which work unbelievably hard just to stay afloat say that especially as so many premier league footballer live just up the road from the two club the hon lady make an important point it be not for government to decide that but know from my own experience that grassroots club play huge role in community the premier league contribute lot it be up to the premier league to decide how much money it put down the pyramid the issue of copyright and creative be big in the news because of artificial intelligence but it have also be long run issue and it be good that the spotlight be on it will the minister look into levy on it equipment so that people who provide their creative material on that receive some effective royalty as happen under the book lending scheme this be an early idea but if he start talk about it now in government we might get some success be happy to look at anything but we be reluctant to start put levy on thing that close down the british business my hon friend make good point about try to make sure that people have an opportunity to make career and living out of the creative industry it strike that with more than of people work freelance in the industry that be one of the thing we definitely have to look at and know that my hon friend have large sector in her constituency somerset be home to some iconic film location such as glastonbury tor which feature in the kid who would be king montacute house which feature in wolf hall and sense and sensibility and wells where hot fuzz be film what step be the minister take to ensure that the film industry in the

make sure that local authority take up such opportunity there have be rapid expansion of new home in my constituency however the development of sport facility in area such as ashby de la zouch be not keep pace and in hugglescote we see fight to save the rec how will the minister ensure that when new home be create we protect and develop new sport facility in park for local people this government

constituency be much cherish local facility which have sadly fall into disrepair and be unable to open for the community this year very good local group be try to raise fund to restore it what can the

disastrous post brexit landscape for tour artist we have the good band and artist in the world and they bring huge joy to we here they want to share the love abroad and in so do bring lot of money to the uk economy will my hon friend assure that he be act with haste as shakespeare say all the world stage and all the man and woman merely player they have their exit and their entrance let we open more door for they and one man in his time play many part clearly my hon friend be one of those people we be determined to sort this out know that there be many of we who fear that we lose many thing

if she will make statement on whether the government will be accept the school teacher review body pay recommendation for may start by thank our teacher school leader and school staff for all they be do right now to ensure successful exam season for student and indeed for all their hard work throughout the year rather than scaremongere with fantasy statistic the government be get on and deliver we be already see positive sign that our plan for change be work teacher recruitment be up with more people in training than last year teacher retention be up with thousand more teacher forecast to stay in the profession over the next three year this labour government be get on and deliver unlike the opposition who last year sit on the strb report hide from their responsibility and leave it to labour to sort out this afternoon we will announce the teacher pay award which will be the early announcement for decade we understand the importance of give school certainty give they time to plan their budget and ensure that they can recruit and retain the expert teacher our child need the secretary of state write ministerial statement will be come out this it will show once again that this labour government order have grant the urgent question so please will member on the opposition front bench wait for the minister to finish her answer do not want you ms trott and mr to be bad example of this school class the write ministerial statement be lay before the house and will be come out this afternoon show once again that this labour government be get on and deliver on our plan for change call the shadow secretary of state mr speaker this be absolutely outrageous it be astonishing that we have have to summon the government to the house today but the minister can not even tell we what pay rise teacher will get and whether it be go to be fund that do not allow we to scrutinise the matter in this house the government say that they would tax private school to fund more teacher but the reality be that state school have not get any of that money instead we have have break promise on compensate school for the job tax confirmation from the department for education itself that there will be shortfall in teacher pay funding which we be not allow to discuss here today in this urgent question and uncertainty as to what the actual pay rise for teacher will be that be disgrace and it be the opposite of what people who vote for labour expect all that be in the final two week when headteacher up and down the country have to decide whether to make teacher redundant in time for september in fact sadly many school will already have make the difficult decision to let good teacher go these be job loss on the minister watch due to her inability to provide school with the clarity that they need do not just take my word for it dan moynihan from the harris federation say that it propose to make to teacher redundant jon coles the chief executive of united learning which run state sector academy say that the trust have be leave with million year of unfunded cost he say it no good treasury wave their hand and say would be job loss sector wide that would extrapolate to ruinous harm in the one well function public service ten of thousand of redundancy simon pink the finance director at the elliot foundation which have primary say this be the tough budget in generation one secondary school headteacher have already have to cut two teaching assistant post and teacher role due to rise national insurance and anticipate wage rise what be the pay rise that the government recommend for teacher the prime minister spokesman say on april there be no additional funding for pay yesterday the government start to turn on the winter fuel allowance will the minister now fully turn and fund the national insurance rise and agree to fully fund the pay increase whatever they be neither nor any minister in this government will take lesson from conservative members who after long year in power have still not restore real term spend in our school to the level that they inherit the brass neck of the opposition be quite extraordinary conservative members would also do well to remember the difficult decision that this government have have to take because of the utter mess that they leave behind the right hon lady be in the treasury create the mess she know very well what happen recruit retain and support expert teacher be central to our vision for deliver high and rise standard in our school despite the challenging financial context and year of miss recruitment target under the previous government this administration be prioritise education and ensure that every child have access to high quality teacher we be work at pace to ensure excellence for every child that be why we remain committed to our manifesto pledge for teacher and to ensure that it respond to the demand in secondary school special school and further education we know that high quality teaching be the in school factor that have the big positive impact on child outcome break down barrier to opportunity for every child so recruit and retain high quality teacher be clearly absolutely central to our vision for deliver high and rise standard that be why despite the challenge financial context and year of miss recruitment target we be get on and deliver on our plan for change the right hon lady will have to wait like everybody else for the statement that she know be come this afternoon call the chair of the education committee teacher pay be absolutely vital for the status of the profession for the quality of life of teacher and for recruitment and retention of the vital skilled and qualified staff who be the backbone of our education system it be really important that the government response this afternoon begin the work of restore teacher pay after the last year when we see by any objective measure shocking erosion in teacher pay under the previous government that have affect recruitment and retention and have devastating impact on teacher morale those on the conservative benches should take note of that because we would all benefit from little more humility in the context of the legacy that they leave behind can press the minister on the extent to which the pay award will be fund we know that there be already extensive pressure on school budget and school be very anxious about that matter also will this afternoon statement include support staff pay and will it begin the process of restore that pay we know how vital our teaching assistant and other support staff in our school be thank my hon friend for her thoughtful contribution find it somewhat disconcert that she be be barrack by conservative members when she perform really important function for this house and be very assiduous in hold the government to account rightly so as that be her role she be right to reflect on the degradation of teacher pay over the past year indeed the first thing this government do be get last year strb recommendation out of the drawer and process it recommendation that the last government hide and frankly run away from we implement the pay award we absolutely recognise that pay be really important part of ensure we have the high quality teacher that we need the start salary for teacher be now at least outside of london and at least in inner london we be make progress we be see the green shoot of more teacher join the profession and stay in it and we will continue to support that trajectory in any way we can my hon friend have also rightly highlight the vital work of support staff in school the government approach in that regard will be confirm in this afternoon write ministerial statement as will all the detail that my hon friend so keenly anticipate call the liberal democrat spokesperson each and every week hear from teacher and school leader in my constituency and across the country in my time in this place never have their outlook be as gloomy as it be right now after year of underfunding and neglect from the conservatives school now face double blow of underfunded national insurance increase and unfunded teacher pay rise if the report be to be believe together these represent massive cut to school budget frankly school expect well from labour school governor in my constituency recently tell that they be all set deficit budget which one describe as beyond imagine that be why teacher be so desperately worried parent be too because ultimately it be our child who will suffer and the most vulnerable at that the government claim that school can find the money through efficiency simply do not stack up budget be already cut to the bone with school rely on parent to buy they the basic such as glue stick through amazon wish list they be already cut back subject cancel trip and cut back on teach assistant mean that child with special educational need and disability will suffer the most and now they be plan redundancy budget decision for next year be already be make we need urgent clarity about whether the pay rise will be fund so will the minister tell school across the country where exactly they be expect to find this money there be an awful lot of imagining in the hon lady question and understandably so less understandable though in relation to some of her comment the statement be due today and the hon lady will have to await it as will all member of this house and those who be keenly look at their school budget to ensure they can provide the good education possible know that be what school be rightly focus on do and we be focus on support they to do that gently remind opposition members that this be the early strb announcement in decade because we recognise how important budgeting be for school and how important it be that they have this information in timely way that be not respect under the previous government we want to provider this information in good time and give notice as early as possible so that school can plan the excellent outcome for child that know they be strive for we will also support they to use their funding as efficiently as possible the department have work on whole suite of productivity initiative as well as support for school to manage energy cost and banking cost and to minimise any expenditure that be not on the frontline support child that be what we will continue to do reiterate what the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes say teaching assistant be the glue that keep our classroom together and they should be pay adequately be pleased to hear the minister state that retention be up with more teacher in training as former teacher understand that workload be often cite as reason that we do not retain teacher marking lesson planning admin and data entry all keep teacher away from spend time with their student can the minister update we on what work her department be do with respect to artificial intelligence and its roll out in our classroom to reduce teacher workload and get they in front of student welcome the constructive nature of my hon friend question because regardless of any announcement this afternoon we know that school be work hard to deliver for child as government we need to work our hard and we be to support they to do so that mean whole range of productivity measure to support teacher with their workload to support school with their cost and to ensure we grab the opportunity of technological development so that any teacher time be maximise with child in the classroom help they with their learning and be support with technology to maximise child outcome we will continue to work we be very much look forward and unfortunately those on the opposition benches seem constantly to be look back for the government to come here today fulling know their pay rise intention but refuse to say so until this afternoon to avoid scrutiny be disrespectful to this house to every member to every constituent and to every teacher if may say so it be somewhat cowardly school across my constituency find themselves short of money to cover national insurance bill five school in my constituency that have approach be short between they do the minister know how many school be short of money to pay their national insurance bill on the hon lady initial comment let say that there be process and procedure in this house that we respect we respect this house and we will continue to do so there be process by which this statement and these announcement will be make she will have to wait alongside everybody for the process that we adhere to in this house to be administer in response to the hon lady second question as she should know our funding system be not design so that every school and college receive funding that necessarily fully match their precise spending as that include nic cost vary from institution to institution because of the decision that each school make on staffing we be provide school and high need setting with more than million in to support they with their increase national insurance cost that be in addition to the billion increase to core school funding announce at the autumn budget in that mean that the core school budget which include the core revenue funding for school and high need setting will total more than billion in we will continue to support school to spend that money in the most effective and productive way possible to maximise outcome for child which be our priority spend most of the last government time in office scrutinise public spending and grow weary of promise of pay or other government decision not be match with budget for school hospital and so on when thing like change to national insurance and pay increase be make hope that this government will be very honest about the impact on school budget and not have headline that be not balance with funding therefore hope the minister be make good argument in the spending review could she make sure that she really lean into the issue of fall roll in london school any hop for pay rise which be much deserve by teacher will be double whammy for school in london because roll be fall and their income be therefore much low that will have an extra impact on staffing decision thank my hon friend for her question and for the work that she have do in this house over many year in scrutinise government budget and hold government to account we have the high respect for school for school leader and for the teacher and support staff who work in school we recognise the challenge face across the public sector to make sure that every penny of public money be spend in the most efficient way possible and maximise the public benefit we be work incredibly hard in the department as know we be across government to get maximum output for public money frankly the public sector be neglect by the previous government over year we be pick up the piece of that and we will continue to work hard to do so do have some sympathy for the minister for whom have great deal of respect but surely she must feel embarrassed to come before this house know all the answer to these question and not give they simply because no will not let she in my constituency school be already face double whammy from an increase in cost from the national insurance rise which be not fully fund and the pressure on place if the teacher pay settlement be not fund in full surely she will admit that it amount to cut whenever this happen when we be in government the first thing labour members would say be be you match it with funding if we be not they would scream blue murder that it amount to cut will she just admit that if it be not fund it be cut to school the right hon gentleman be rather get ahead of himself he be in the last government and we be leave with an appalling inheritance we be take tough decision to fix the foundation and to bring back stability because education be priority for this government that be why we be rebuild the crumble school that the conservatives leave interruption fiction crumble school suggest opposition members speak to the school that be deal with the consequence we be roll out free breakfast club open up school base nursery and yes provide billion to give every child the good start in life through the high quality early year and family service that the previous government promise but provide no money to deliver while those on the conservative benches continue to try to work out what they think we be get on with deliver real positive change in our country as the minister say we inherit recruitment and retention crisis in the teaching industry datum from the national association of head teachers show that one in three teacher leave within five year and that around one in three headteacher no long continue as head within five year that be the situation we have inherit not create what be the minister do to turn the tide on the recruitment and retention crisis we do inherit dire situation child be not be teach by the expert teacher they should have be teach by and teacher be stretch to the limit that be why the first thing we do be to reset the relationship between the government and school which for year have resemble some sort of combat we want to work with school we recognise how hard they be work to deliver for child and we want to work with they to support they in any way we can that mean have high quality teacher and good quality teacher training it mean support every teacher to be train to meet the need of child with special educational need and disability it mean maximise every pound so that it can get to the frontline to the child by reduce other cost in school we will continue to work with school to do that so that we can ensure that every child have the expert teacher they deserve and will not be let down any more as they have be for the last year think we would all agree that education be the good investment that any government can make it raise people out of poverty improve social mobility and improve health outcome sadly it be not priority for the last government and welcome the change in tone from the new government although think it will take more than breakfast club to fix the problem the devon branch of the national association of head teachers have say we on our knee primary school be consolidate class because they be have to cut spending and one secondary school in my patch will have to pay extra for every percentage point rise in pay that be not fund if the pay award be not fully fund can the minister explain exactly where school be suppose to find this extra money the hon lady be understandably so give the calling of this urgent question despite statement be due imminently get ahead of herself and we be do an awful lot more than breakfast club have list just some of what we be do but we be work incredibly hard across the board school will work very hard to make sure that their budget maximise the outcome for child and we will continue to support they to do that that mean have department that step up it do not stand back and criticise it step up it mean support the buying that school do and make sure they be get the good value for money in all the purchasing they do it mean support they with their maintenance and management it mean support they with energy cost we know that expenditure on energy be big cost for school and the department can provide support with good contract that get much well value for money it be similar with banking and with teacher vacancy school can save significant amount of money use the product available from the department for education which we be continue to provide and they can use the tool available to see how they be do and also what other school be do well we will continue to support school to maximise order this be like have second statement the answer be get long and long but have to get through this urgent question as we have lot of other business it be important that question be answer quickly but also that the rest of the question be ask we will now have good example of brief question from laurence turner thank you mr speaker there have clearly be some learn loss among the conservatives because they be late in submit evidence for seven year in row cause chaos in school budget they announce the outcome of the school teachers review body process through write statement to this house and shamefully they scrap the school support staff negotiate body do the minister agree that the protestation from the opposition will come across to teacher as false and hypocritical because they be think my hon friend have put it very well one of the thing think we should be proud of in england be the success of english school over the last to year frankly the difference in outcome in england from those in labour run wales or snp run scotland have be very striking demonstrate that while for sure there be brilliant teacher across the united kingdom the different system in england have enable its school to flourish while welcome the fact that the minister be bring the statement out early and appreciate the work the government have do on it be afraid that do share the frustration of my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott and my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson who be no long in her place the minister must appreciate that frustration give that she be sit on the opposition benches only few month ago as no doubt she will be again in only few year time the reality be that it be very difficult to represent those who send we here if we be not give information be send letter by simon beamish who run the leigh academies trust and he tell that school in my area of west kent be already go to have redundancy or be go to make choice base on the unfunded pledge that have be give will the minister make commitment that the next pledge will be fund that be very long question it be very long statement that manage almost entirely to look backwards while fantasise about the future the right hon member will receive the information as will everybody else when the statement be publish at the announce time this afternoon declare an interest as be primary school governor right up until the election and be the chair of the all party parliamentary group for school learning and assessment it be quite shocking to hear opposition members protestation about school funding give the absolutely dire state in which they leave school funding after year of conservative government when speak to school leader in my constituency they tell about their real and lasting struggle to balance their budget understand that the minister can not speak today about the outcome of the review until the statement but can she give we information more broadly about conversation she have have as part of the spending review so that we can get the funding we need to invest in school and turn around the dire situation we inherit would like to take this opportunity to put on record my thank to school governor my hon friend mention that he be governor up until the election we really be grateful to school governor for everything they do on voluntary basis to support school to be as good as they can be as government we will always work with they and school to support improve outcome for child the department will do everything it can within the incredibly tight fiscal constraint we inherit as government we be commit to our public service which we know will transform the life of child and everybody in this country we will continue to do that the minister in her response to my hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson refer to imagining but do not think it be an imagining to suggest that the secretary of state in her response to the strb say that some efficiency saving would have to be find in school to meet the additional cost early this week have roundtable with headteacher from my constituency and beyond the minister also talk just now about fantasise about the future be she really tell that those headteacher be fantasise about the future when they tell that they be already have to make cut to staffing number for next september one headteacher tell that just one or two more thing need to go wrong and that they be on the brink of collapse be the minister say that they be fantasise about the future no we recognise how important it be for school to plan their budget and we know that they be keenly await the announcement this afternoon that be why we have make the announcement as quickly as possible and much quick than at any point over the past year we will continue to work with school to help they deliver for the child in their care we know that that be their priority and it be our priority too for year see my profession treat like dirt by the conservative party undervalue underpaid and undermine at every single turn do the minister agree that not only should we be pay our teacher fairly but we should be treat they with respect and that the only decent teacher recruitment the conservative party do be to recruit former teacher to the labour benches my hon friend rightly remark on his service as teacher it be incredibly value the one message we want to send to the school system be about the extent to which we value the teacher and the headteacher who support their school to thrive and the extent to which we support the support staff who be the beat heart of school in every community we will continue to do so the school in my constituency tell that any efficiency they could possibly make have already be make therefore the result of what the minister be announce the national insurance increase that be underfunde and this welcome but unfunded increase in teacher pay can only be that teacher number be cut as the father of primary school teacher who work really hard and be absolutely committed that impact on personally and it will impact on every child and every parent in my constituency be that not the reality and should the government not be up front and admit that this will mean that teacher will lose their job the right hon gentleman will have to wait for the statement this afternoon for the detail of what the government be propose he really should have more awareness of the situation that teacher and school and indeed our entire public sector have face over the past year we be work hard to clean up that mess and we will continue to do so declare that be also school governor have spend many month in my constituency meeting teacher governor and stakeholder within the community so welcome the government announcement of additional teacher can the minister tell we how the government be turn the tide in the teacher recruitment and retention crisis which reach unprecedented level over the past decade this be key priority for we we want to ensure that we have the teaching workforce that child deserve but that teacher deserve too they deserve to have full fleet of teacher teach the specialist subject that they love be commit to and be train to teach we know that key to unlock the outcome for child be have good qualified teacher in every classroom which be what we be legislate to achieve it be also key for child with additional learning need or disability that we ensure that every teacher be teacher for special educational need and disability so that more child can be educate in their local school with their peer and get the outcome they deserve be school governor for year and serve as finance governor so know these issue well want to draw the minister attention to the plight of small rural primary school there be many such school in my constituency and they be really up against it with the cost that they face in the school that serve of the budget be spend on staffing so significant unfunded increase in staffing cost whether through national insurance or salary contribution have huge impact will the minister meet to discuss sparsity funding and the equalisation of per capita funding so that primary school in small rural area be not so serially disadvantaged thank the hon gentleman for his thoughtful question and for his year of service as governor can not reiterate enough how much we value the work that governor do in school and we need more people to step up and take the rewarding opportunity to support school in that capacity he rightly raise the challenge which we know differ across school and that be why school funding be not uniform across school it vary accord to circumstance we be look at the funding formula to ensure that it do allocate resource where it be most need and where it can give the great outcome and the great benefit rather than the synthetic outrage from the former chief secretary to the treasury the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott who serve in government that bring cut to school really welcome that the government be serious about address the regression teacher face in their pay as well as the fact that support staff be push on to the minimum wage trust that in the statement there will be sufficiency in the funding for school but will the minister also get grip of escalate chief executive pay which be double mean they have six figure salary it be really important that they be not take more out of the fund that should be invest in child education my hon friend speak with great insight know she care passionately about maximise outcome for child know that every school leader indeed those at any level within school but particularly those at the senior level will want to ensure that in any decision they make on pay they be prioritise outcome for child school in my constituency tell they be struggle serious pressure be be put on their staffing budget by the national insurance contribution increase and that be exacerbate by the appallingly slow approval rate of special educational need inclusion funding and education health and care plan by the now lib dem run cambridgeshire county council what be the minister do to address that extra strain on staffing cost and to ensure that school be properly resource for the right level of staff in order to allow teacher to give all child the good education rather than force efficiency saving on they that will make the job even hard and possibly even ultimately put child at risk the hon gentleman raise an important matter and do so thoughtfully and constructively although there be synthetic outrage from some member on the conservative benches we recognise that school be grapple with the challenge of ensure that they achieve the great outcome from their budget that be challenge that they rise to year on year and challenge that we will continue to set because we will not shy away from ensure that every penny of public money that be spend deliver on the frontline for child and teacher we need to ensure that we have the right teaching capacity in school and that teacher be train to support child with special educational need we be determined to ensure that more child be educate with their peer but we recognise that school need support to deliver that and we be work on reform at pace we be also get on with deliver whole range of intervention to support school in make progress have not plan to ask question but have to say that be pretty surprised by the tone that the opposition strike do postgraduate degree in education and will never forget find one of my professional mentor who have be teacher for year cry at her desk because of the pressure that the then government have put on she and other teacher be it not the case that the conservatives leave our teacher overstretch and undervalue and this government be take different approach could not have put it well myself the minister have admit that not all school will be fully fund but blame that on the choice that school have make about their staff do she accept that school can not fully control the profile of their staff and that in some case make this point in letter to the minister school choose to pay people in high band because of the increasingly high need that they be expect to support will she meet to discuss how she will protect school with particularly high staffing budget from have to make excessive cut be not really sure about the premise of the hon lady question or what she think may or may not have be say ahead of publication of the write ministerial statement which be due at pm today have make it clear that school be fund not in uniform manner but accord to whole range of requirement that they may have within their school population and their area it be complex formula that be intend to ensure fairness across the school funding system indeed we be look at the system to ensure that it be as fair as it can be but it be not without its complexity so we be take the time to get this right we will continue to do so because we recognise that school need the autonomy to decide how they spend their budget how they well deploy their resource and how they maximise the outcome for child use the resource allocate by the government we also recognise that school need support to do that and we will continue to ensure that they have the tool to maximise the outcome for child may declare my interest as the very proud father of rosie foundation stage teacher this government show what labour be about when they come in and immediately award an above inflation pay rise to teacher to start claw back after the demeaning and disrespectful public sector cut of around in real term deliver by the tories the government submission to the pay review body be below inflation and that increase would not be fund through additional finance it would come at the expense of other provision it have be report that the school teachers review body be recommend close to so will the government commit to long term plan of restore teacher pay in real term and to address the recruitment and retention crisis in education my hon friend tempt down all sort of path in way that would anticipate the statement that be due later today but he rightly state the importance of ensure that teacher be recognise value and reward that we have sufficient teacher and that we have an attractive profession that bright people like rosie want to join and contribute to we will continue to work to deliver that for the child and school in this country one of the big driver of satisfaction in any profession be settlement in line with inflation and expectation of inflation will the minister assure the house that the settlement to be announce later today will take account of the fact that inflation be vastly high than be anticipate when the settlement be reach be afraid that the right hon member will have to wait for the statement this afternoon appreciate that it be keenly anticipate we be committed to ensure that school can deliver for child that be our top priority be proud to declare an interest as the son of teacher while the tories often wax lyrical about how business add value to our economy which of course it do they often omit to say that it be our teacher who educate those who go on to work in business teacher add huge value and teaching should be the most esteemed of profession can the minister explain how labour be overturn the teacher recruitment and retention crisis that we inherit from the tories my hon friend be right to say that we inherit teaching profession in crisis immediately on enter government we institute pay award we continue to help school to find way to support teacher in manage their workload and wellbeing and in make teach the attractive profession that it should be as my hon friend rightly point out teaching be the springboard to so many bright future for child we want to ensure excellence for every child not just some child as we see over the last year in education question raise the concern of headteacher in basildon and billericay about school funding and directly ask about school support staff who be already be tell that they be be make redundant because of the national insurance job tax can the minister explain to those staff and why the government have go back on their promise to cover all the cost of the job tax as have already set out the government have give significant settlement in recognition of the national insurance cost we will continue to work with school to ensure that they can deliver for child in their area and we will continue to listen to the sector to ensure that we work in partnership to deliver for child partnership that be sadly lack in the last year the right hon gentleman be very much part of the government who deliver the desperate situation in which we find school and teacher and that we be work very hard to turn around over the last six month have visit most of the school in my constituency and the message be get loud and clear be that they be on the brink especially over special educational need and disability provision that threaten to throw into sharp reverse any progress on educational standard ask the government to be honest about the real state of funding and not to make statement that be not fully fund that apply to statement on exist service such as send provision and on the cost of school dinner hold the new government to high standard and ask the minister to be completely honest about the real state of affair recognise the challenge that the hon gentleman see in the school system we do without doubt inherit send crisis it be describe by the previous secretary of state for education as lose lose lose and she be not wrong we be work at pace to fix it and we recognise that school be grapple with many challenge we will continue to work at pace because that be how we deliver for child in this country which we be commit to do order the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison have just walk right across the floor of the house while the minister be answer can not believe it interruption we be not go to have an argument would have hop that you as member of the panel of chairs would respect the rule of the house well be full of admiration for all the hard work teacher across my constituency and indeed the whole country and my sister in law be secondary school english teacher but have no doubt that every teacher and headteacher watch our proceeding either live or later will have have their jaw on the floor when they hear the minister say that she want to give they time to plan but will not tell they what funding they will get to pay for this it be inconceivable that she do not know the answer to that question give that statement on the issue will be publish at be she not give the answer because as my right hon friend the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden say no have tell she not to well still be it because the department be in live negotiation some might say row with the treasury to get that settlement for our teacher what ridiculous question as the hon member have family member who be teacher he should have more respect for the profession and the work that teacher do he should acknowledge that the time we give school to plan their budget be way beyond anything that his government deliver in the last year the minister and many hon member have mention teach support staff who make up half the school workforce but have no statutory pay body to represent they many support staff be leave without voice in discussion on their pay term and working condition hear that time and again in school throughout my constituency will the minister give assurance through the write ministerial statement that school support staff will get fair pay deal pay negotiation for support staff be do through the national joint council for local government services we recognise the challenge that the hon member identify and the strong role that support staff play in our school we have legislate for the school support staff negotiate body which the last government abolish to be re establish to ensure that they have strong voice in these conversation may raise concern about our further education college teacher there be real shortage of skilled worker in this country and one of the reason for that be that we have undervalue and under invest in our fe college teacher who be pay less than their peer no wonder of they leave within the first three year of employment do the minister recognise the vital role of fe college teacher in our education system will they be in the government plan for fair and well future for everybody we absolutely recognise respect and value the vital role of all those who work with to year old and people of all age whether in school college or fe setting they provide that springboard to launch people into their future career we will continue to recognise and support the sector the minister mention maintenance contract and department for education support school have see steep increase in the cost of sustain themselves one school leader in devon whom speak with say that the cost of maintain ground bin and toilet grow by over the last four year give that school budget have barely grow over that period do she really expect that staff pay rise will come out of exist school budget the hon gentleman tempt into issue that may well be address in the statement that be due very shortly he recognise that school have whole range of cost to manage as department we want to maximise every penny that school have and to minimise outlay that do not reach child or the frontline those who work with child we will continue to do that there be whole range of tool available at the department we really encourage school to use those tool in any way they can in the management of their budget and to support really smart accounting to maximise the impact of their budget for their child thank the minister for her answer to the urgent question nobody can doubt her commitment to the change that be necessary to keep school work and teacher in place always try to be helpful in the chamber northern ireland have come through period of teacher strike action which lead to year of no school inspection and to alter classroom practice so there be need to re engage with teacher the minister know well that engage with teacher at all stage be essential or the loser will undoubtedly be the parent and of course the pupil how will she ensure spirit of co operation to ensure in depth education we all hope that co operation will be reciprocate by union and senior leadership team in all school the hon gentleman be always helpful and thoughtful in his contribution as department we inherit school system that be in crisis school building crumble teacher leave in their drove and child not get the start in life that they deserve we be work on number of front but we recognise that the outcome be not one that the government alone can deliver we need to deliver they in partnership with school teacher and those who represent they we speak and work regularly right across the board to maximise those outcome for child and know the hon gentleman share our determination to see that across the country on point of order mr speaker be it relevant to this uq it be mr speaker early the minister say that funding have remain below level be sure that be an innocent verbal slip however accord to the widely respect institute for fiscal studies come on the back of an real term increase in spending per pupil between and this allow spending per pupil to return to and exceed its previous high point in how can we encourage the rapid correction of the record when innocent mistake be make think you have just correct the record that be not point of order we can leave it at that unless the minister want to come in indicate dissent independent sentencing review with your permission mr speaker will make statement on sentencing in england and wales as the house will be aware the independent sentencing review be publish today it be chair by david gauke and his panel comprise expert include former lord chief justice and representative from the police prison probation and victim right organisation the government be grateful for the review recommendation and will ensure that copy be deposit in the libraries of both houses today will set out our in principle response first however it be essential that we set the review in its proper context year ago today the conservative party call an election they do so because they be confront by the prospect of prison about to collapse rather than confront their failure they choose to hide it and hoodwink the public into re elect they it do not work but their legacy live on our prison be once again run out of space and it be vital that the implication be understand if our prison collapse court be force to suspend trial the police must halt their arrest crime go unpunished criminal run amok and chaos reign we face the breakdown of law and order in this country it be shameful that in this day and age we be confront by this crisis once more the reason be clear the last government add just place to our prison estate while at the same time sentence length rise as result the prison population be now rise by each year and we be head back towards zero capacity it now fall to this government to end this cycle of crisis that start by build prison since take office we have open place last week announce an additional billion for prison building put we on track to hit place by in the large expansion since the victorian era that investment be necessary but not sufficient we can not build our way out of this crisis despite build as quickly as we can demand for place will outstrip supply by in early and that be why commission the sentencing review its task be clear this country must never run out of prison place again there must always be space for dangerous offender at the same time the review be task with address the fact that our prison too often create well criminal not well citizen instead of cut crime they be breed ground for it the reviewer have follow the evidence and example of country across the world today present an initial response with further detail to follow once legislation be place before the house let start with the report central recommendation the move to three part sentence call the earn progression model which the government accept in principle under the model an offender will not necessarily leave prison at an automatic point instead their release date will be determine by their behaviour if they follow prison rule they will earn early release if they do not they will be lock up for long that echo the model witness in texas early this year which cut crime and bring their prison population under control under the new model offender serve standard determinate sentence with an automatic release of or will now earn their release the early possible release will be one third with additional day add for bad behaviour the review suggest new maximum of but for those who behave excessively badly will not place an upper limit for those currently serve standard determinate sentence with an automatic release point of their early possible release will be again for those who behave excessively badly will not place an upper limit david gauke also suggest that those serve extend determinate sentence should also earn an early release this we will not accept judge give extended sentence to those they consider dangerous with no parole board hearing until two third of time serve and will not change that can also confirm that no sentence be serve for terror offence will be eligible for early release from prison in the second part of the progression model offender will enter period of intensive supervision that will see more offender tag and close management from probation the government will therefore significantly increase funding by the final year of the spending review period an annual billion will rise by up to million allow we to tag and monitor ten of thousand more offender if offender do not comply with the condition of their release the sentencing review have suggest that recall to prison should be cap at day we have agree to this policy in principle though the precise detail will be place before the house when we legislate in the final stage of the three part sentence offender could still be recall if new offence be commit and will also ensure that the most serious offender continue to be subject to strict condition the review also recommend reduction in short prison sentence compelling case for do so have be propose in this house many time in the most recent datum nearly of those receive month sentence reoffende within year with reoffende rate for community punishment consistently lower we must ask ourselves whether alternative form of punishment would make the public safe it be important however to note that the review recommend reduction in short sentence not abolition it be right that judge retain the discretion to hand they down in exceptional circumstance in consider exceptional circumstance we will continue to ensure that court have access to thorough risk assessment for domestic abuse and stalking case and breach of protective order link to violence against woman and girl will be exclude the review also recommend an extension of suspend sentence from two to three year in this period the prospect of prison time hang over an offender should they break any condition impose upon they and we accept that recommendation the recommendation set out above will see more community punishment for that reason it be essential that it work the review recommend series of measure to make community punishment tough and force offender to pay back to those they have harm we will consider new financial penalty which could see offender asset seize even if they be not knowingly link to crime and expand use of punishment such as travel and drive ban that would curtail offender liberty we accept recommendation to expand intensive supervision court those impose tough condition include treatment requirement that tackle the root cause of prolific offending offender be bring before judge regularly to monitor compliance and the prospect of prison hang over they like the sword of damocles however believe community punishment must be tough still unpaid work must pay back so will shortly bring together business leader to explore model whereby offender work for they and the salary be pay not to the offender but towards the good of victim will also work with local authority to determine how unpaid work team could give back to their community whether by fill pothole or clean up rubbish invite david gauke to consider cohort of offender who this government believe require particular focus welcome his recommendation on female offender approximately two third of female offender receive short sentence around the same number be victim of domestic abuser be pleased to say that the review recommendation on short defer and suspend sentence will reduce the number of woman in prison ask david gauke to consider how we tackle foreign national offender today our deportation rate be ahead of the last government welcome the recommendation to make it quick and easy to deport foreign criminal under the exist scheme they be send back to their country of origin after serve of the custodial sentence we will bring that down to we will also conduct further work with the home office on how we can deport foreign prisoner serve less than three year as soon as possible after their sentencing also ask the review to consider how we manage sex offender the review have recommend we continue pilot of so call medication to manage problematic sexual arousal will go far with national roll out begin in two region cover prison be explore whether mandate the approach be possible of course it be vital that this approach be take alongside psychological intervention that target other cause of offending such as assert power and control when discuss sentencing it be too easy to focus on how we punish offender when we should talk more about victim everything be announce today be in pursuit of justice system that serve victim if our prison collapse it be victim who pay the price by cut reoffende we will have few victim in future but there be more we must do to support victim today the review recommend number of important measure include well identify domestic abuser at sentencing so that we can monitor and manage they more effectively pay tribute to those who have campaign on this particularly the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde also welcome the recommendation to expand the use of specialist domestic abuse court where train staff support victim to improve transparency in the system we will extend pilot of free sentencing transcript for victim of rape and serious sexual offence want to go far than the review recommend to well support victim exclusion zone be an important tool prevent offender from enter area their victim might be in but these place great limit on victim than on offender want to change that lock offender down to specific location so that victim know they be safe wherever else they want to go this review set out major reform know its recommendation will not be welcome by all by appoint david gauke former conservative lord chancellor hop to show that two politician from different tradition can agree on the reform our justice system require do not expect conservative member to join to solve this crisis in fact can hear their soundbite already just build fast they will say well we be build fast than they do we have already add place and we be now invest billion more just deport more foreign criminal they will say well we be ahead of where they be and today we have accept major reform to go far and fast clear the court backlog they will say despite have create it themselves well we be invest more in our court than they ever do and we be ready to embrace once in generation reform to deliver swifter justice for victim while we be do more on each of these area than they ever do these be not solution that rise to the scale of the crisis that they leave behind we must build prison on an historic scale deport foreign national offender fast than ever and speed up our court and yet still despite all that we must reform sentencing too so more in hope than expectation and despite not because of experience by appeal to the well angel of their nature if they have any end by invite those opposite to help we fix the crisis that they leave behind commend this statement to the house call the shadow lord chancellor today be about one question should violent and prolific criminal be on the street or behind bar think they should be behind bar for all the justice secretary rhetoric the substance of her statement could not be clear she be okay and her party be okay with criminal terrorise our street and torment our country the truth be this any order think people have come to listen to the statement and expect they to listen expect the opposition front bench to be quiet certainly expect well from the government front bench mr speaker the truth be this any government serious about keep violent criminal behind bar any government willing to do whatever it take could obviously find and build the prison cell require to negate the need for these disastrous change what do the change amount to interruption order mr swallow you be get very excited you be tell how good schoolteacher you be this be very bad example of that what do these change amount to they be get out of jail free card for dangerous criminal have the justice secretary even go through court list recently pick one from anywhere in our country those currently go to jail for month or less be not angel they be adam gregory in calne who get month for sexually assault his partner vinnie nolan who get month for break someone jaw shaun yardley month for beat his partner or paul morris who get six and half month for shoplift time her plan be to let precisely these criminal loose it be recipe for crime wave what about the justice secretary plan for most criminal go to jail to serve just one third of their prison sentence there and for her slashing of sentence across the board discount so big they would make aldi and lidl blush would call it joke if the consequence for the public be not so terrifying in fact it get bad because criminal who plead guilty and most do already get third cut in their sentence so under her scheme burglar who plead guilty to an month headline term would spend just one fifth of that term in jail barely week eleven week for smash through family door and storm through child bedroom look for valuable leave they traumatise for life be that the justice secretary idea of justice for victim the least she could do be here and now guarantee that violent criminal domestic abuser stalker and sexual assaulter will not be eligible for any discount in their sentence will she commit to that if not prison what be the plan to punish these criminal and to keep the public safe well the justice secretary say it be digital prison as she put it prison outside of prison word that lead most people in this country to conclude that the justice secretary be out of her mind be all for technology but tag be not iron bar they can not stop your child be stab on their walk home from school or shop be ransack time and again or domestic abuser return to their victim front door order do not think that out of her mind be language that should be use be sure the shadow secretary of state would like to reflect on that of course mr speaker the ministry of justice own pilot scheme find that of tag offender breach their curfew when it come to stop reoffende tag be about as useful as smoke alarm be at put out bonfire what be the justice secretary go to say when she meet the victim of offender that she let off how be she go to look they in the eye and say with straight face sorry we be look into how this criminal escape from their digital prison cell her reform be recipe for carnage urge the justice secretary to change course and to make different choice yes choice from the one that we know the government would make from the day that the prime minister hand pick lord timpson as minister of state for prisons probation and reducing reoffending man who be on record as say that lot of people in prison should not be there two third of they in fact he say and they be there for far too long the labour party be clearly ideologically oppose to prison and that be why the government be let criminal off with get out of jail free card rather than deport the foreign national offender in our prison one in every eight cell figure that be rise under the justice secretary watch if she be actually serious about keep violent criminal off our street and find the cell that be need will she bring forward legislation tomorrow and disapply the human rights act which be stop we from swiftly deport foreign national offender some prisoner be on remand await trial another figure that have rise under the justice secretary in fact her own department figure forecast that it could rise to as many as if she be serious will she commit to take up the lady chief justice request for extra court sit day to hear those case and free up prison space will she commit here and now to build more than the meagre rapid deployment cell her prison capacity strategy say she be plan to build this year they have be build in seven month before and they can be build even fast if the justice secretary be serious she would commit to strike deal with the european country with spare prison capacity rent their cell from they at an affordable price as denmark be do with kosovo between and her beloved texas the state on which she model these reform state that by the way have an incarceration rate five time high than that of the united kingdom build extra cell if the government be serious why can they not build over similar time period labour be not serious about keep hyper prolific offender behind bar in fact there be nothing in the justice secretary statement on lock they up or cut crime because the labour party do not believe in punish criminal and it do not really believe in prison the radical terrible change make today be cloak in necessity but their root be labour ideology it be the public who will be pay the price for her weakness the shadow secretary of state talk about serious government if the government that he be part of have ever be serious they would have build more than prison place in year in he be new convert to the prison building cause he and his party have never stand up in this chamber and apologise for add only place order want the same respect from member on the opposition front bench interruption do we understand each other indicate assent mr speaker if be wait for respect from opposition members would be wait for long time so it be good job that do not need it the shadow secretary of state talk about iron bar but he be part of government that do not build the prison place that this country need unlike he take responsibility and it have fall to to clean up the mess that he and his party leave behind in case there be any confusion let spell out what happen when he and his party leave our prison system on the brink of collapse which be exactly what they do and set out the prospect that face on day one when walk into the justice department when prison be on the verge of collapse we basically have only two choice leave at our disposal either we shut the front door or we have to open the back door the right hon gentleman party know that that be the situation it be confront with but do it make any decision no it just decide to call an election instead and do runner the public put the conservatives in their current position if they ever want to get out of that position suggest that they start by reckon with the reality of their own track record in office in any other reality they should have start already with an apology conservative members have have many chance to apologise to the country for leave our prison on the point of absolute collapse but they have never take they frankly that tell we everything that anyone need to know about the modern conservative party call the chair of the justice committee welcome the report and the government response it be comprehensive and measured response to the prison crisis as one would expect from david gauke in contrast with the hysterical nonsense that we have hear from the opposition today particularly welcome the additional resource for probation and electronic monitoring to enable robust punishment and control in the community as an alternative to custody but even the aggregate effect of the measure in the report will only stabilise the prison population over the long term do my right hon friend agree that we also need effective rehabilitation to end the cycle of reoffende if we be to see fall in historically high prison number let be clear we will be add prison place to the estate and we will be fill they up the prison population will rise year on year by the end of this parliament but my hon friend be right that the measure we have announce today stabilise the prison population as whole country we will have to do well at ensure that our prison be churn out well citizen rather than well criminal when we know that of offender be reoffender there be clearly much work to be do in this area call the liberal democrat spokesperson start by say that it be an absolute honour to be able to share with my mum who be survivor of domestic abuse at the hand of former partner that campaigning fuel by our harrowing experience at home all those year ago and the experience of many other survivor across the country have contribute to the government heed our call to well identify domestic abuse in the criminal justice system the increase visibility and the intervention that it will inform to patch up what be an outrageous gap in the system stand to protect victim and survivor across the country and sincerely thank the government for listen to we my party and will hold the government to account on the implementation and we would like to get clarity on the record that the new identifier will mean that the government can be empower to exclude domestic abuser from for example an early release scheme and that partner use clare law will see offence flag as domestic abuse in the light of the report it must be say that it be absolutely appalling that the shadow justice secretary have just try to play politic with domestic abuser do not want to let criminal out early you do the right hon gentleman say that this government want to let domestic abuser out early he fail to remember that the end of custody supervise licence scheme under the conservative government from october to june last year release offender early with no exclusion for domestic abuser do the secretary of state agree it be critical that this government provide more support for domestic abuse victim from the like of their abuser in way that the last government fail to do on their watch thank the hon member for his remark would accept nothing less than hold we fully to account for these change and look forward to work collaboratively where possible on these measure as we move forward pay tribute to he his family and his mum for the campaigning that they have do on the identification of case arise from domestic abuse be flag properly within our justice system the new identifier will develop over time and be sure that it will inform future policy decision make by government of all stripe but it be an important starting point we be very happy to accept the recommendation and we will move at pace to ensure that we deliver it case under clare law will be cover by the new measure as for more support for victim of domestic abuse we be very keen to take forward the review recommendation on the specialist court because we think they will have particularly important role to play as say in my statement we will ensure that the measure relate to the presumption against short sentence contain an exclusion for breach of order which we know be matter of particular concern for victim of domestic abuse will engage with member across the house on where we can make further progress before put my question to my right hon friend may give the shadow justice secretary reality check under the previous government of report rape case go completely unpunished under the conservative government rape be effectively legalised so little bit of humility would not go amiss one in five adult in this country will experience domestic abuse in their lifetime could my right hon friend please explain how domestic abuse victim will be protect under these new measure will repeat the point have make to the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde we know that there be particular concern about what the presumption against short sentence might have mean for breach of protective order and we know that issue be of real concern for domestic abuse victim we want to ensure that those order be not render useless because those who breach they be not see any prison time at all the specific circumstance surround this type of violence against woman need very specific response which be why we have already say that we will make that exclusion and will work with member across the house to identify where we can make further progress welcome what the secretary of state have say about female offender but would like to know little bit more hope street in hampshire which offer residential alternative to custody for woman have see remarkable result and of course it prevent those woman from be separate from their child which would otherwise drive the intergenerational cycle of offend behaviour trauma and cost to society do these proposal include any plan to set up more such facility across the rest of the country the hon lady raise an important point the combination of the measure that we be accept from the review will mean that we will see huge reduction in the number of woman go to prison approximately two third go in for sentence of less than one year and as the hon lady know many of those woman be themselves victim of domestic abuse in future we expect the number to drop very significantly and know we will make progress in that regard have set out an ambition to see few woman prisoner and ultimately to have few woman prison turn to residential alternative to custody the hon lady will know that have set up the women justice board it be well represent include by those who have personal experience of hope street and we will work with the women justice board as we roll out further change to the female estate despite what the shadow justice secretary have say about this scheme put domestic abuser and rapist out on the street can the justice secretary cut through the rhetoric and fearmongere from the opposition and be clear that she have put the victim of sexual and domestic abuse at the heart of these measure can she confirm that they will be protect and that those abuser and perpetrator will not benefit from the early release scheme all dangerous offender those who receive an extended determinate sentence include some of the serious offender to which my hon friend have refer will be exclude from this scheme all other offender receive standard determinate sentence will be within the earn progression model but they will have to earn an early release that be why we be ensure that there be an uplift in probation funding to ensure that all those individual be intensively supervise in the middle stage of their sentence the bad thing that could happen for every type of victim in this country and in fact for every citizen would be for we to run out of prison place altogether we be in this position because of the mess that the previous government leave behind and it fall to we to fix it notwithstanding the predictable nonsense from the shadow leader of the opposition the right hon member for newark robert jenrick it be critical that we focus on the need of the victim welcome the lord chancellor make that point in her statement but we need more than fine word can she please commit to give all victim of crime proper access to restorative justice restorative justice have an important role to play in our justice system so where it be appropriate and where it can make difference we will ensure that it be available but want to ensure that victim of crime have other confidence induce measure at their disposal which be why want to look at exclusion zone in particular and it be why we want to do the domestic abuse identifi so that we can track system learn from the case that be go through and make well policy for victim be amazed by the gall of the conservatives who leave our prison in utter crisis fail victim thank the lord chancellor for her work five year ago my constituent diane have her world change when her husband be kill by driver who be on her phone not only do the driver do that but the first call the driver make be not to but to her sister when the driver be release from prison she will have four year driving ban but diane and her family have have their life devastate forever can the minister set out that as we take this necessary action to fix our burst prison system we will make use of lengthy restriction and lifetime driving ban for those who cause death by dangerous driving be sorry to hear of the case of my hon friend constituent those be truly horrible circumstance for any family to find themselves in can assure she that we will be rigorously pursue the recommendation in the gauke review relate to ancillary order which be other order that we can make that curtail an offender liberty include lengthy driving ban which be consider bring forward public confidence in the criminal justice system and importantly the confidence of victim be paramount since the use of community base order have decrease by that be in no small part because of concern about offender engagement in the process if the government be go to pursue this route what step have the lord chancellor take to model how many will reoffend and more importantly that they will be rigorously reinforce that issue be why already today have announce measure to toughen up community punishment and we will be go far in some area than even the review recommend absolutely agree that community punishment have to maintain the confidence of the public like all other member be constituency member of parliament and want my constituent to be able to see community punishment as real punishment it be on we to make sure that it be worthy of that name that be why be consider go far on unpaid work work with business to see whether salary could be pay into victim fund that might be one model want to see offender fill pothole and clean our street and will be work with local authority to ensure that we go as far as we can but assure the hon gentleman that this government be commit to toughen up community punishment and make sure that it maintain the confidence of the public be grateful to the lord chancellor for her statement and for commission the sentencing review do she agree that this government be now take action whereas this time last year rather than sort out the prison crisis when we have few than space with prison population of the conservatives call general election instead do she also agree that the present proposal will ensure that dangerous offender will be lock up and will enable we to rehabilitate other and stop reoffende which cost we billion year my hon friend be right this time last year the conservatives have chance to put the country first instead they call an election and try to put themselves first they do runner on the job and it fall to we to clean up their mess this government will clean up their mess and we will get our prison system on to sustainable footing so that there be always prison place there will be more prison place under this government and we will make sure that there be always prison place for the most dangerous offender that be why we be take all the other measure that we need to take to ensure that we never run out of prison place again respect for justice be diminish by the fiction of the judge announce sentence and those in the know then calculate on the back of fag packet the fraction that it actually represent have this statement not reinforce that system with bell on be sorry to have to break it to the right hon gentleman but he will be horrify to discover that he agree with david gauke on this one the independent reviewer have point out that transparency will be paramount to maintain confidence in the justice system and we will make sure that we take the transparency measure forward with the national police chiefs council have declare violence against woman and girl national emergency it be right that we explore radical method to bring down the scale of offend in our community we know that most sexual offending be not about sex at all but about power however for the subset of convict whose offending be drive by sexual compulsion chemical castration could be an option be there estimate datum on how many future offence that could prevent by definition it would only be for those who have already offend as be not aware of method of permanent chemical castration be there capacity in the probation service to monitor ongoing compliance with treatment study show reduction in offending my hon friend be right to say that for one subset of offender offend relate to power for another subset of offender we believe that combination of chemical suppressant and psychological intervention can have big and positive impact pilot have be trundle along for many year and nobody have show much interest in it include any of my predecessor tory justice secretaries just let it carry on be not willing to do that and be not squeamish about take further measure we be go to have national roll out of this programme and will ensure that be what happen be expand it to two further region include for prisoner in further prison so that we can build the evidence base and make sure that we be use every tool at our disposal to cut reoffende welcome the government commitment to extend the pilot scheme to give free sentencing transcript for rape and serious sexual offence something for which have long campaign be sorry that the victims minister the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones have just leave the chamber because want to pay tribute to she for all her work on this issue also pay tribute to the victim survivor and campaigner and particularly my own constituent juliana terlizzi for their bravery and advocacy on this issue look forward to continue to work with the minister on this issue can the lord chancellor tell we what measure will be take to ensure that victim know about the scheme and that they understand their right to request transcript of the sentencing remark know that the pilot have show how much that contribute to their recovery and their welfare after sentencing pay tribute to the hon lady for her work in this area and will pass on her remark to the victims minister also pay tribute to her constituent it be very difficult to raise these issue and talk about they openly and her constituent have show real bravery in come forward and explain why the scheme would have make difference to her own recovery be very pleased to extend the pilot scheme we will learn the lesson about how the first pilot scheme work in the first year and if we need to do more on publicise what the scheme can do and its availability we will do so the hon lady will know that want to make further progress on use ai technology to make transcript more widely available because believe in transparent justice system do not believe that we be very far away from have tech that be accurate enough to be matter of court record but we be not quite there yet it be something we continue to work on in my year as crown prosecutor prosecute many many case but prosecute far few individual that be because of offender be reoffender so see the same defendant time and again the current system do not work do the lord chancellor agree that the new approach will reduce reoffende cut crime and lead to few victim my hon friend be absolutely right to remind the house that of offender in our country be reoffender which tell we that our system be break it tell we that our prison be create well criminal not well citizen and this be something we absolutely have to turn around if we be to protect victim and cut crime the lord chancellor will know that for very long time in this country the prejudice of the establishment poison by liberal thinking have be at odd with the preoccupation of the vast majority of law abide people will she acknowledge now that the principal purpose of prison be retributive it have other purpose too but its principal purpose be punishment in that spirit will she confirm when she will bring forward the further legislation on sentencing that she promise give what she have announce today will she also confirm that violent sexual offender will be exclude from early release have no truck with anyone else prejudice and they certainly do not decide what do in office believe in prison this government be go to build more prison place and we will fill they believe in prison for the reason of punishment primarily agree with the right hon gentleman on that will not let this country run out of prison place because know what will happen if we do be not willing to put anyone through the breakdown of law and order in our country be not willing to take that risk it mean that hard choice be in front of and this house as we get ourselves out of this crisis and be make those choice today will work at pace to bring forward legislation at the early opportunity so that the house can consider the proposal in full those on extended determinate sentence the most dangerous offender as judge by judge in court will be exclude from these measure for all other offender early release will have to be earn and there will be intensive supervision afterwards that be the earn progression model and be sure we will debate it at length in the week and month ahead there be no place in our country for foreign offender who pose serious risk to the public this government be already return more foreign national offender than the conservatives do when they be in power do the minister agree that the tories be clearly all talk and no action my hon friend put it very well and he be absolutely right we have make more progress on the deportation of foreign national offender than the previous government and we will go far we accept the review recommendation on reduce the threshold for early removal from to for offender who get less than three year in prison we will work with the home office on proposal to move to immediate deportation the national average reoffending rate for people who have do short term sentence be among those who graduate from prisoner rehabilitation programme in my constituency the average reoffende rate be just the programme be still in touch with every single graduate after operate for year in the spirit of try to reduce the prison population do the lord chancellor agree that such rehabilitation programme be absolutely crucial and that invest in rehabilitation not only keep people safe in the community because it reduce the reoffende rate but help the mission to free up prison place for the dangerous criminal who absolutely need to be there the hon lady make good point pay tribute to the work that be go on in her constituency as have say before of offender in this country be reoffender that tell we how break our system be and how imperative it be that we sort it out welcome my right hon friend statement reoffende be cost we billion year and of offender be reoffender do my right hon friend agree that we need to bring that figure down what be she intend to do to prevent people from reoffende at such high rate one of the problem of run prison system at absolutely boil hot where it be permanently on the point of collapse as have be the case in our prison system for far too long now be that we be not able to make much progress in the prison estate on the programme that offender need to access to begin rehabilitation journey part of our proposal which be design to relieve the stress in our prison system will help with rehabilitation within the prison estate we be also absolutely determined to make more progress on rehabilitation outside the prison estate which be why we be toughen up community punishment we know that that work and we know that the country can have confidence in such punishment we will be work with our colleague in the department of health and social care to think about the availability of drug and alcohol treatment we will expand the use of sobriety tag which be already help offender to come off the drink that often fuel their offending have ask some tech company to look at far technological innovation that can help we in this space the holy grail would be drug tag which could make huge difference in reduce reoffende in our country we will continue to press ahead and work as quickly as we can to find further technological solution crime against child be among the bad crime humanity can commit there be relatively little if anything at all about offence against child in this review could the lord chancellor confirm that those who have abuse child will not be allow out early all those who have receive an extended determinate sentence and that include many of the offender mention by the hon lady be exclude from these measure all other offender would have to earn an early release by prove that they have behave properly in prison and not break prison rule the minimum for they be set at one third of the sentence but it can be high as have say for those who egregiously offend we will set no upper limit we hear this morning that probation service in nottinghamshire have be rat inadequate follow visit by inspector they have be judge as understaffed with urgent improvement need therefore welcome the million increase for probation service but can ask the lord chancellor what other step can be take to drive up probation standard in constituency like mine be very grateful to my hon friend for raise issue relate to the probation service we have already expand the number of staff last year we recruit extra and this year we be on track to hit our target of extra staff increase resource first and foremost with more staff be clear priority for we we be invest in technology to help the probation service to be more productive we have already fund programme and pilot on ai tech design to decrease the amount of file work that probation officer have to do to allow they to have more time to do the thing that only human can do to spend time with the offender in front of they to come up with proper plan to reduce their reoffending and therefore to keep the public safe very much welcome the lord chancellor statement and know that victim and survivor of domestic abuse and sexual violence in my constituency will do so as well thank she and her ministerial colleague for their cross party working include with my hon friend the members for eastbourne josh babarinde and for twickenham munira wilson on the domestic abuse recommendation and the application of domestic abuse at sentencing will the lord chancellor consider whether it be possible to tag those offence retrospectively as well as at sentencing also welcome her remark about transcript and transparency in the light of the pilot on transcript for sexual violence and rape case will she consider include in that pilot the entire transcript not just the transcript of sentencing on tag retrospectively will certainly go away and have look at that point suspect although do not want to mislead the hon member or the house that retrospective trawl of all case include common assault which be where we see most domestic abuse case land for charge and criminal case may be beyond where we can get with the datum available to we and the time it would take however go forward we will try to capture exactly those case not only domestic abuse connect offence but other offence such as common assault which we know have take place in domestic abuse context so that they be all flagged and proper datum be keep on transcript sentencing remark be currently available for other victim such as in murder case and so on and that will be extend to victim of rape and serious sexual violence to repeat point make early believe in transparent justice system would like to be in the position of use ai technology to make not just sentence remark available we be think about make broadly what happen in court and such transcript more widely available what inhibit we be cost and we be try to take out that cost by look at ai model but we can not proceed with anything unless we be absolutely certain about its accuracy because as be sure the hon member appreciate document purport to be record of what be say in court need to be bang on welcome the fact that this government be get on with build the large prison expansion programme since the victorians that be labour government in action fix the tory prison crisis once and for all can ask the secretary of state to learn from the snp scottish government abject failure with the new barlinnie prison project in glasgow it have be delay again and now will not be ready until which be nine year late the cost have soar from million to staggering billion for one prison will we learn lesson from the snp failure thank my hon friend for his question let tell he that we have already learn the lesson of the tory party failure and be very sorry to hear about the situation he describe in scotland the conservatives failure on prison building stem from two thing they could not get it past their own back benchers so the planning delay add billion to the cost of prison place expansion and they do not make certain and available the amount need to stimulate funding at the rate require we have reverse both those thing we have make billion available and we have make it very clear that planning will not get in the way of prison building several year ago when be magistrate in westminster and my father be magistrate in north wiltshire we lament great deal about the fact that when we put people in prison we find that there be whole list of antecedent every time and that this recur all the time could the secretary of state tell the house what assurance she can give we about prison education rehabilitation programme and regular work programme so that we avoid the pattern of prescribing with good intention solution that do not work cost lot of money and leave the public pretty dissatisfied with the justice system pay tribute to the right hon member his father and magistrate all over our country they do an incredibly valuable job of keep our justice system go in fact magistrate deal with of all criminal case the right hon member be refer to prolific offending the people who keep come back cycle in and out of the system the review recommend that we switch to model of intensive supervision court where judge be in charge of make sure that treatment programme be adhere to we will take that forward and will set out more proposal when we bring forward the legislation the early pilot which in fairness be start under the previous government have show very positive progress in help those offender to turn their life around and break the cycle of addiction or mental health problem that often lead to prolific offending we will build on that work what do the secretary of state make of the extraordinary admission by the former lord chancellor last year that the previous government choose not to take action on the prison crisis because you have to win vote fortunately the conservatives do not win any vote in margate broadstairs and ramsgate which be why stand here today to say that neighbourhood in east thanet be blight by drug dealing theft burglary sex trafficking and antisocial behaviour which ebb and flow accord to whether the main criminal organiser pimp co ordinator and dealer be in or out of prison cause mayhem do she agree with that the shortage of prison cell because of the conservative party and the lack of alternative punishment because of the conservative party have contribute to that situation which blight the life of those in our community my hon friend make an incredibly powerful point and she be absolutely right when we have prison system on the point of collapse it be not as if the criminal do not know that that be happen that be why it be imperative that we get our system under control and ensure there be always prison place available for those who have to be lock up to keep the public safe her point about win vote show the approach take by the previous government they put themselves first not the country first on behalf of the justice union parliamentary group welcome the independent review recognition of probation officer and join the call from the national association of probation officers for extra direct investment in staff now stable accommodation on release be also key to offender rehabilitation there be presently no approve premise for woman in wales and woman centre struggle for funding so how will the justice secretary improve rehabilitation and life chance for welsh woman in the criminal justice system very much hope that the position for welsh woman will be the same as for woman in england which be that we see huge reduction in the number of woman in wales and england enter the female prison estate that be because the combination of the measure david gauke recommend in particular on short sentence will mean that few woman go to prison will of course work with colleague across wales to look at what more we can do on accommodation provision know that there be no specific centre in wales the right hon lady and have discuss that previously it be promise make by the previous government without any funding attach to it so be not able to make decision when first come into office that could reverse that but we will work with the women justice board and other to ensure that the offer for woman who be now no long go to prison be still strong and help they on their rehabilitation journey this be day of shame for the conservative party one of their own have lay bare the scale of its failure leave we with nowhere to put the prisoner conservative use to call themselves the party of law and order take it from this former police inspector they lose that label long ago and they be never get it back move forward the criminal justice system be just that system decision take on policing court probation and prison all affect one another so will the lord chancellor assure that the implication for police and the enforcement of sentence be be take into account when we roll out the change my hon friend be absolutely right it be day of shame for the conservative party be sorry to see that the attitude of conservative members today be shameless he make very important point on police have have good conversation with police leader be determined to use the national criminal justice board to ensure that every part of the criminal justice system be align and that we take into account all the interaction base on this review and on the upcoming criminal court review and think about the impact they have not just on the bit of the justice system be directly responsible for but on the wide criminal justice system include police as whole may first say to the lord chancellor that have huge personal respect for she may disagree with some some by the way not all of what she have announce today but would like to put that on the record she mention female offending she will know that there be six mother and baby unit in female prison in england there be application for the last period we know about up to march with place for mother and place for baby allow for twin clearly there be not enough place have she consider as part of this review when there be not serious and violent offending by female prisoner get more of those mother and baby into the community rather than have they in prison let thank the right hon gentleman for his remark of personal respect which be share across this house thank he for that and for the important issue he raise hope to move to position where the combined impact of the change in the review and the work we be do with the women justice board mean that we see huge drop in the number of female prisoner be particularly keen to ensure that pregnant woman and mother of young child be not anywhere near our female prison estate in future of course for serious offender we will always need to make sure that prison be an option but the vast majority of woman go to prison on short sentence for much less serious offence and we need to turn that around under the last conservative government the number of foreign criminal in our prison rise to the ten of thousand shamefully will the lord chancellor outline for my constituent what we be do to deport those foreign criminal from our prison as quickly as possible to free up vital prison space my hon friend be absolutely right we be deport at fast rate than the previous government we have accept the review recommendation to drop the threshold for early removal from this country from of the custodial sentence to we will urgently work up plan with the home office for those who be sentence to less than three year to be deport as quickly as possible after sentencing in her statement the lord chancellor say that under her earn progression plan if offender follow prison rule they will win early release the review say that thousand of offender will benefit from that can she explain to my constituent why simply follow the rule mean that serious offender will serve only third of their sentence where be the punishment and where be victim interest in that approach the hon gentleman will know that the track record of his party in government be to run prison boil hot with violence off the chart the shadow justice secretary have be show huge amount of concern for prison officer and the violence they face in our prison would have hop that the conservative party might welcome some incentivisation in our prison system to make sure we can run safe prison and keep our prison officer safe make sure that people follow the rule and that that be how they can earn an early release mean that those who break the rule will serve long in prison thank my right hon friend for her statement and her razor like focus on fix the broken justice and prison system this government inherit may welcome the million to help rebuild probation service and ask question on rehabilitation and make community punishment pay think many people in my constituency will welcome focus on community punishment be use to do job such as fix pothole and rebuild service that be need locally equally want community punishment to pay by break the cycle of reoffende can she tell we more about how this programme will get business and apprenticeship into prison and give young offender way out of that cycle so that we stop they be in prison for second and third time my hon friend raise really important point this be why the government have already roll out employment work council where prison link up with employer in their region and try to make sure that there be job and training available for offender on leave prison we know that the ability to work be really important part of drive down reoffende that be priority for this government of course unpaid work be very visible way for offender to make reparation to the community they have harm in our eye that be the primary focus of it but the discipline of do that work can help offender who be far away from the world of work to get close to it the government plan lie out an expectation that they will be able to manage ex offender in the community under intensive supervision probation officer in my constituency recently tell that she be tell off by her boss for spend too long with offender when she be book just minute appointment can the lord chancellor tell when the promise investment will actually reach frontline probation service and can she guarantee it will be enough to ensure public safety and reduce reoffende let reassure the hon lady that this be huge uplift in funding for probation it be billion budget as it stand and it will increase by up to million by the end of the spending review period we have already invest in pilot ai and other technology design to improve productivity where ai can complete much of the paperwork that lot of probation officer spend far too much of their time on often repeat the same information in different document that show huge promise we will roll that out at pace to give probation officer more time with the offender in front of they do the thing that only human can do which be to get to grip with what be drive that offender behaviour and have plan to tackle it include by access treatment programme and other thing in the community we be determined to make sure that the probation service can rise to the scale of the challenge the funding will help with that as will our investment in that technology rise order we have number of member still to get in so can hon member remember to keep their question and answer short location and curfew restriction use electronic tagging to stop hyper prolific offender go anywhere near place where they could reoffend requirement to engage in mental health drug and alcohol treatment include the use of sobriety tag to address the cause of criminality put offender back to work clean up the community they have harm chemical castration for sex offender the speeding up of foreign deportation and the large prison expansion ever do the lord chancellor agree that this be about put victim and the public first my hon friend be absolutely right this government be determined to clean up the mess leave by the previous conservative government and to put victim first cut crime and make our community safe under the yoke of the snp scotland already have presumption against short sentence and now the new scottish commission look at sentencing and penal policy have be accuse of be pack with activist determine to keep criminal out of jail why be the lord chancellor in westminster follow this lead and fail to put victim at the heart of the justice system what absolute rubbish be sorry to say be not take any lesson from the hon gentleman or the snp this be programme for england and wales for which be directly responsible and we be go to make it work when previous government fail to take responsibility for the crisis they have cause they deserve life sentence on the opposition benches welcome the construction of new wing at ranby prison in my constituency by worksop base laing specialist in modern method of construction that be involve in many other construction project across the country if the minister be seek more site for new prison could propose the crown own land across the road from hmp ranby we would very much welcome new prison there shall take my hon friend early bid for further building in her constituency under advisement immediately under these proposal foreign criminal will be deport after serve of their sentence which appreciate be an improvement the public want they to be deport right away do the lord chancellor the review recommend immediate deportation mean as quickly as possible because we still have to detain people before we can get they on plane and back to their country of origin for sentence of under three year we be go to work up proposal on that with the home office for more serious offender with sentence of over three year we be go to bring the threshold down from to thank the lord chancellor for her statement today which be sensible response to the overincarceration and prison place crisis can she assure my constituent that notwithstanding these change under report and under prosecute crime such as violence against woman and girl will continue to be prioritise by this government this government will make sure we be run prison system that be sustainable and not on the point of collapse so that we can ensure that dangerous offender in this country be still lock up we will make progress on our broad mission to halve the level of violence against woman and girl over year welcome the lord chancellor statement and the work that david gauke have do to inform everything that be happen today as member of the justice committee look forward to see he before we shortly seek clarity on what the lord chancellor refer to as the so call medication to manage problematic sexual arousal will she place the available research and conclusion in the library so that we all have access to the information and can understand the datum on which she and david gauke have rely be happy to ensure that the evidence be available would say to the hon lady that the very small scale pilot that inherit have be run for some time without anybody pay huge amount of attention to it and the evidence from other jurisdiction where it have be roll out bit more widely be strong our roll out want to get to national roll out will start with two extra region and more prison and we will build the evidence base there we want measure that work and do believe that the combination of chemical suppressant and psychological intervention can help with cohort of particularly difficult sex offender in the last four year of the previous conservative government the number of foreign national offender increase now call old fashioned but believe that non uk citizen who commit crime within the uk should not serve their sentence here today report make good progress and welcome the lord chancellor tackle this issue urgently it be what south norfolk want to see and it will get capacity back in our prison my hon friend be absolutely right we be already deport more foreign national offender than the previous government we be take forward the measure from the gauke review to speed up and get more foreign offender out of our system and back to their country of origin wholeheartedly support my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson in his call for the immediate deportation of foreign criminal what be the lord chancellor do to ensure that the court be not hold up those deportation and that once deport those criminal be never allow back on these shore the hon gentleman may have see that just last week when the home secretary set out the immigration white paper we announce that we be review the use of article in relation to immigration case and we will bring forward our proposal on that in due course we will not allow the misuse of our court and the use of article to enable people who have no right to be in this country to stay in this country that will require change to the immigration rule which the home secretary be work on do the lord chancellor agree that the voluntary and community sector can play vital role in support offender to rehabilitate and gain vital employment and housing organisation such as pathways care farm and access community trust in my constituency have help to prevent reoffende pay tribute to the organisation in my hon friend constituency such voluntary organisation play hugely important role in help the justice system to succeed in rehabilitate offender we will continue to work closely and build on the review recommendation in this area have sit on the public accounts committee inquiry into prison overcrowding know full well the issue at hand and who to blame can the lord chancellor assure and my constituent that they will not be place in more danger by the government not jail criminal when those individual be in the community the local community must have voice in the effectiveness and planning of these new sentence lest we end up with community concern similar to those about bail hostel in tiverton and minehead what put the whole country at risk include current future and potential victim of crime be let our prison system collapse and will never let that happen the measure we be take forward from the review today be design to make sure that this country never run out of prison place ever again will ensure that there be ample time for debate and discussion across this house as we bring our legislation forward be the lord chancellor as astound as be by the hypocrisy of the conservatives they really be the arsonist attack the firefighter we be have to clean up their mess because in the word of the national audit office this crisis be the result of their failure to ensure that the number of prison place be align with criminal justice priority after some month in this job face the shadow ministers be afraid that nothing about their behaviour surprise any more will take notice as think will the country when the conservative finally offer an apology for the absolute abject mess they leave behind police officer magistrate and judge all report that some offender would rather go to prison to be back with their mate watch sky tv and have three square meal day do the lord chancellor agree that those who go to prison should be treat more harshly and robustly than be the case under the year of the previous conservative government we want to make sure that our prison be use to punish offender that those offender be make to abide by strict prison rule that they engage with programme in prison to bring down their propensity to reoffend and that ultimately we succeed in keep my hon friend constituent safe by turn out well citizen rather than well criminal there be thousand of decent moderate conservative all across the country who will have see the ridiculous spectacle today of the opposition denigrate david gauke of all people on the prison system the review be absolutely clear that short sentence be drive reoffend within the year will the minister set out the step that she will take to cut crime and create few victim my hon friend be right we have to cut crime have few victim and make sure that our street be safe that be why we have to make sure that we never run out of prison place that we never see the breakdown in law and order that would ensue be that to happen and that we take forward package of measure that have announce today we work on the legislation in the come week and month which will be design to make sure that we do not run out of prison place that we put victim first and that we cut crime in this country call tristan osborne for the last question on this statement leave the good until last madam deputy speaker as former police officer can say that community payback work do the lord chancellor agree with and many of my colleague in the criminal justice system that rehabilitation of offender include fill pothole and clearing fly tipping be popular not only in chatham and aylesford but in newark and across the country my hon friend make an incredibly important point be determined that we toughen community punishment and make sure that unpaid work truly pay back to the community that have be harm by crime that be why work with business and local authority so we can all have system that drive down

it that he have notify the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith that he intend to refer to he in the chamber indicate assent the chair be not responsible for the shadow secretary of state remark but the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee have put his point on the record datum use and access bill lords consideration of lords message must draw the house attention to the fact that the lords amendment engage commons financial privilege if lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal before clause requirement to make provision in relation to transparency of copyright work use in relation to ai model pm beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment want to start by put on record something that should perhaps have say bit more about in this place cherish the uk creative industry their immense contribution to our national and personal life their embodiment of the good of human creativity and appreciate the sincerity of their concern about the future want to express my genuine gratitude to the whole of the creative sector from national treasure such as sir ian mckellen kate bush and yes sir elton john whose performance enrich our life have see all of they perform live can say how much that have personally enrich my life to local artist such as pauly the painter whose painting of hove enrich my ministerial office in whitehall however this be not competition about who love the sector most it be an argument about how good to champion the interest of creative large and small and to protect and promote they into the future the purpose of the data use and access bill be to well harness datum for economic growth to improve public service and to support modern digital government and acknowledge the agreement reach in the other place on scientific research and sex datum to that end the bill before we today be one step close to completion and be grateful to minister baroness jones of whitchurch for her work on these important issue be sure the house will unite in wish she happy birthday today it be significant birthday but will not do she the discourtesy of mention which one this bill be never intend to be about artificial intelligence intellectual property and copyright however the other place have yet again suggest that there be an amendment on this issue despite hon member of this elect house have already remove similar amendment twice before madam deputy speaker also note your decision that the amendment from the other place still conflict with the financial privilege of this place as my hon friend the minister for data protection and telecoms have state repeatedly we absolutely recognise that workable solution on transparency be key part of tackle this issue but we absolutely disagree that this bill or this amendment be the right way to address it thank the secretary of state for mention kate bush she be the love of my life and have be since be nine we have repeatedly speak about the need for tech solution to address this issue have background in datum and technology and have be meet several company that seem between they to have possible tech solution will the secretary of state meet and they to discuss it be extremely grateful for my hon friend intervention for her love of kate bush which share and for her passion for find workable solution and way forward as go through my remark hope she will see that propose way to formalise the insight wisdom and experience of the kind of company that she reference so that they can move forward it be because of the complexity around ai copyright law and the understandable sensitivity of content creator that this need to be do properly and carefully in consider measure and reason way that be what this government intend to do in order to make progress all of we need to work to find some common ground and reflect on thing that we could have do well in that spirit let say to this house and the other place that regret the timing of the consultation on copyright and ai and the consideration of this bill and the way that the two collide and regret that by indicate preferred option it appear to some that have take side in the debate before everyone feel that they have be listen to welcome the secretary of state word it be great to hear word such as cherish and champion in this house acknowledge that there be no opt out in the bill but the secretary of state mention the consultation that be launch alongside it which adjoin these very issue will my right hon friend confirm once and for all that the government prefer opt out for reserve copyright be now abandon be grateful to my hon friend for her comment just to clarify this be legacy bill which have be in parliament several time before include under the previous government so it be always inevitable that at whatever time the consultation be launch it would have coincide with the bill go through parliament that be never my intention but as have just say accept that that be the impression give when we go into the consultation believe that opt out could have offer an opportunity to bring both side together but now accept that that be not the case this afternoon we will go to the ivor novello award to celebrate the ability and talent of the good of our songwriter from across this country it will be magnificent and wonderful display those writer be seriously concerned that their work will be ingest and churn out in an inferior way the government be not offer anything to our creator the amendment that the lords have present seem to be reasonable so what be wrong with it as way forward as have say and as will elaborate the government and believe that there be well way forward to give the creative sector and creator the protection that they need it would deliver they the certainty protection and ability to have transparency and to be renumerated and provide more possibility to large creator or those who represent they to deliver licence into the future we need to take the issue in the round not just one part of they hope that the hon gentleman have great time at the ivor novello award congratulate everyone who win have be nominate or be participate today especially who be think receive an award other creator who have see live many time many of my constituent have tell that they feel that their work have already be scrap and that ai development have already trample over their right what reassurance can the secretary of state give that we already recognise that this be time limit issue and that action be require my hon friend make pertinent point it be true that much content have already be use and subsume by ai model usually from other territory and under the current law nothing illustrate the need to have comprehensive think about the way forward than the example that he have just give on that point will the secretary of state give way see that the right hon lady the chair of the culture media and sport committee be on her foot and of course give way appreciate the tone in which the secretary of state have start his speech minister keep repeat mantra about the uncertainty of what our copyright law say about ai training however there be no uncertainty commercial generative ai training on uk copyright work be illegal in the uk but what rightsholder need be what this amendment say clear relevant accurate and accessible information about the use of their copyright work use and the mean by which those work be access legislative vehicle in the future however welcome will be simply too late to protect the livelihood of so many of the uk million creative worker who fear that this uncertainty line be just an excuse to undermine copyright law be the government really commit to proactively enforce our copyright law if they do not do so through this bill now how will they do it and when be grateful for the hon lady intervention which be thoughtful as always may pick she up on one substantial point have not use the word uncertainty or imply that the challenge we have be uncertainty exist copyright law be very certain but it be not fit for purpose all the danger and the exist loss into ai model have happen within the exist law the challenge that we have which will go into far be happen currently we need to ensure that we can have domestic legal system that be fit for the digital age we can not rely on legislation that be create for and be still only effective in the analogue age want to give certainty the reason that be make this speech be to give certainty not only in my word but most importantly in legislation in the most rapid fashion possible so that creative and the ai sector can move forward together unfortunately at time the bill have be present as battle between creative industry and new technology company but nothing could be far from the truth thank my right hon friend for his tone and for the direction of travel that he be set out bear in mind that he be talk about the most rapid fashion possible why be the government refuse to put notice of backstop power for transparency in the bill that be what the creative industry would like to see in order to give reassurance that in anticipation of further legislation along the line the secretary of state and the government give themselves the power to act when and if they see that the current rule be be break systemically by ai and tech company be grateful to my hon friend nobody speak with more passion and insight on the subject than she do simply say that the amendment be not comprehensive enough and do not tackle the need and opportunity of both sector the only way that our country will benefit from the maximum potential that both these sector present be if we can bring they together to find way forward pit one against the other be unnecessarily divisive and damage both the truth be that grow britain economy need both sector to succeed and to prosper britain have to be the place where the creative industry every bit as much as ai company can invest and grow confident that their future prosperity be assure we have to become country where our people can enjoy the benefit and the opportunity of both there be an investment battle for britain happen and we must win it my right hon friend tone be most welcome but it be also consistent with how he have be both in private and public on this matter and thank he for that while share much of his taste in music do he agree that transparency should be prerequisite for all ai development not matter for copyright to handle if not now will he commit to include such power in secondary legislation should the voluntary approach fail be grateful for my hon friend tone and for the way that he have engage so fruitfully passionately and effectively both on the record and in the conversation that we have have together transparency be the foundation upon which we will build the future solution to this problem in moment will go on to talk bit more about how intend to deliver that progress but in order to have remuneration solution and the empowerment that creative need in the digital age of course we need transparency which be essential and immutable will strive on behalf of creative to deliver those thing in way that be also enforceable and will make the tangible difference to give they the grip that they need in digital age that they be currently lack in the age that we live in the secretary of state talk about deliver certainty but do he not see that the certainty he be give be to large multinational tech company that will be able to get away with scrap original content that be copyright through the bill he will give such company the certainty to abuse the right of creative in all sincerity be confuse by the hon gentleman intervention the bill before we do not mention ai or copyright it have nothing to do with those item the data use and access bill be as describe at the beginning of my remark if there be clause sentence or paragraph of the legislation that be before we and for consideration that damage either the ai sector or the creative industry then would like he to stand up and read that out what be propose be comprehensive solution in legislation to both the opportunity and the challenge present to the ai sector which be barrier for company in that sector investing here and to the current direction of travel that be pose an existential threat to the nature of the creative sector as we know it that be what be propose and assure the hon gentleman that the bill before we do not damage any of those interest in the way that he suggest thank my right hon friend for the way in which he be comprehensively show our commitment to the creative industry like he be huge nerd when it come to amazing new innovation in datum and ai be hugely enthusiastic about they but also share his equally huge enthusiasm for the creative industry appreciate what he be say about transparency for that be the absolutely key point but what be the backstop if the voluntary approach do not create the transparency that creator need to understand how their creation be be use and if they be be remunerate properly for that the reason open the consultation in the first place be to try to understand where the concern be and where the tech company can provide their suggest solution on the back of which we can come together as two houses of parliament and two separate sector to find the way forward if we can not answer the question that my hon friend pose how will the legislation which will propose as soon as can get through either house we need to bring both sector together we need to have workable implementable solution that have grip in the digital age as well as the confidence of both houses to get the legislation forward ask members across this house and in the other place to offer degree of trust that will lead it through the difficult challenging process which have bedevil not just the current situation but the government before need to deliver it for those who need it the most rise rise will give way to my hon friend the member for southend east and rochford mr alaba who be the first on his foot then will come to my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell appreciate the tone with which the secretary of state be conduct this discussion and thank he for that have spend two decade run business and project in the creative sector before enter this house may ask the secretary of state to confirm when the government intend to bring forward the promise ai and ip bill will he commit to prioritise transparency obligation in the next parliament or even to find suitable vehicle finally will stakeholder be formally consult before that bill be introduce we can see what fast learner my hon friend have become since he have be in this place as he get three question into second intervention will take they in reverse order assure he that will engage with both sector and give meaningful voice include find way of engage view across the house in that process on his first two question have strive to speak perhaps even stretch the boundary of the clarity with which be allow to speak about the future when it come to legislation and the process and formality of this house in which we be govern by tradition convention and the wrath of the leader of the house know and hope that when offer my word member with vary degree of experience will understand that there be meaning behind they about the speed enthusiasm and determination to get this issue resolve swiftly but the legislative programme of the house be in the hand of his majesty the king and the leader of the house for whom we have high regard know that she will be watch somewhere in this building ready to pounce should step one millimetre out of line hope my hon friend the member for southend east and rochford will understand as go through my remark and speak in bit more detail about my intention that the necessity for speed and alacrity underpin every single one of my word rise rise will give way once more before make some progress on the point about speed determination and the convention of this house with regard to the legislative programme in some way that give the secretary of state case for put backstop power on the face of this bill to create the confidence that the creative industry require so that we do not have to wait for full legislation have some confidence now would give the government the power to enforce if they see something that pass the test and there be some transgression there be case for what we be ask for because of those constraint let be as direct as possibly can the amendment before we do not include power of enforcement it would give power to the secretary of state but it give no indication of how those power should be use give that ambiguity it would be incumbent on to use the power in way in which see fit and would see fit to do thorough engagement on the back of such power before use they if decide to use they at all any of my successor in the post could well use those power in vastly different way which would lead to great instability in an area where be determined to create stability finally it would be disempowere for this place to have all those power in the hand of the secretary of state and future secretaries of state when what we really need be comprehensive set of legislative measure that this place and the other place have fully endorse be on statute and can give the security that both sector need into the future it be remiss of to take the intervention of my hon friend the member for east thanet ms billington even though it be an important one before the intervention of my hon friend the member for york central to whom turn now do take word speak at the dispatch box as commitment so really welcome what the secretary of state be say will he ensure that beyond transparency there will be accountability that be the miss element in the lords amendment in particular we need accountability for those business and platform that go on to make profit out of our creative work they should be hold to account as the secretary of state approach this issue in more comprehensive way work with the secretary of state for business and trade the range of intervention show several thing include the breadth of wisdom and experience in this house and the complex nature of the issue at hand that be all be deal with by one amendment that do not actually touch on many of the issue that be be question about again that reinforce the need to deal with this issue in the round and in its entirety with all its complexity will turn to the point that my hon friend raise shortly but the extraterritorial nature of the way in which ai be be consume scrap and bring into the model add challenge to get grip on it that be why have bill that incentivise investment in this country alongside give modern digital right and obligation to creative in the digital age be way in which we can incentivise company to come and obey the law of this land as we move forward believe one more member be on their foot to whom be yet to give way while agree with most of the secretary of state music recommendation pay tribute to girls aloud who be the ultimate pop icon in the british music industry sugababes surely close second will the secretary of state commit to chair cross sector working group with the ai industry and the creative sector in the room to help to inform any future legislation kind of regret take that intervention because it contain the first reference to band have not see live have some life goal yet so will add it to my bucket list will turn to the point that my hon friend make then make progress because we have limit time here and want to ensure that opposition figure have all the time that they need to make their point these issue need serious and dedicated consideration we have never need the language of conflict betrayal or slavery in this debate will the secretary of state give way be go to make some progress will try to give way bit later it be time to tone down the unnecessary rhetoric and instead recognise that the country need to strike balance between content and creativity transparency and training and recognition and reward that can not be do by well mean but ultimately imperfect amendment to bill that be never intend to do such thing the issue of ai copyright need properly consider and enforceable legislation draft with the inclusion involvement and experience of both creative and technologist to that end can tell the house that be now set up series of expert work group to bring together people from both sector on the issue of transparency licensing and other technical standard to chart workable way forward will ensure that the outcome of these endeavour be make available to member of both houses know that people want this issue resolve speedily understand that just as understand the anger and frustration of creative who feel that their contribution be be take without proper recognition or reward the copyright system must be design so that it work for creative and ai company alike will the secretary of state give way be go to make some progress but other voice will be hear much of the creative content on the internet have already be scrap elsewhere in the world we can not turn back time and nor should we kid ourselves that we can exercise extraterritorial reach that we simply do not have my determination be to get this absolutely right not just rush it right now which would make we feel well but would make no real improvement to the status quo let be absolutely clear to the house get it and will get it right finally just as regret that this have be portray as choice between creative and artificial intelligence it be regrettable to that this have become an issue of contention between this house and the other place this house be not put the interest of one sector above those of another that would be the wrong approach the right approach be to recognise that this be too important and complex an issue to be rush it deserve proper consideration and it require we to accept our responsibility to do this right in way that reflect the seriousness of the situation and the sensitivity of both sector for now let we just put this datum bill behind we give the constructive tone that the secretary of state be take today would he like to say word of praise for the upper house without whose determination to keep revisit this matter he might not have feel it quite so necessary to come to this house today and outline in such detail the constructive alternative he wish to put forward of course acknowledge the point that the right hon gentleman make have acknowledge couple of time already in my speech the work of the upper house and several member of it and the constructive and functional way in which we have resolve disagreement on other part of the bill that be the way both houses be design to work in co operation sometimes with tension but ultimately to deliver the legislation that the government intend to introduce use the primacy of this place hope that the right hon gentleman will recognise that this be not the first time have engage privately or publicly many of the statement have make today have be make previously but not in the pointed way that be do now which hope rise to the moment we be in have already acknowledge how look back would have take other action to bring this matter to conclusion much soon also hope that other member across this house and in the other place will similarly act in way that can put this moment behind we so that we can focus on use the power of government and of course of both houses to get this right for those sector that be count on we to do just that from this moment give this house my personal commitment from the dispatch box to unstinte work alongside both sector work together to resolve the contentious issue of ai and copyright quickly and effectively will report back to this house regularly on the progress make my responsibility as secretary of state for science innovation and technology be to bring forward proposal on copyright that can deliver the balance we seek between the interest of the creative industry and those of the ai industry we will do that and we will get it right rise on point of order madam deputy speaker the secretary of state have speak for minute in debate that be due to last for an hour and we have yet to hear from the opposition front bench spokesman there will not be time to have proper debate on this matter which be of great importance to number of people will the government please make available more time beyond the minute time limit thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order which be not in fact point of order he will be aware that the programme motion have already be agree to by the house as hon member know the substance of this bill begin with the previous government in recognition of the need to streamline and harness the use of datum to grow the economy and drive improvement in the delivery of public service as have say before when the bill start its life most of we have no idea that it would become the vehicle for address some of the most important social and technological issue of our time although welcome the huge benefit that the bill will bring to the economy and public service when it come into force fear that it will go down on the government record as the bill of miss opportunity it be miss opportunity to fix our flawed public data set which present barrier to track and tackle inequality in area such as woman health miss opportunity to commit to review of protection for child in their use of social medium platform and to take action to increase those protection where the evidence show there be good reason to do so and miss opportunity to provide much need certainty to two of our key growth industry the creative and ai sector on how they can interact to promote their mutual growth and flourish it could be see as somewhat dispiriting to be back at the dispatch box again have the debate on copyright and ai with the department ministerial team but see that there have be an upgrade since our last outing at the dispatch box pay tribute to the secretary of state for his tone and his approach to this debate particularly his recognition of previous mistake make as politician we do not say sorry often enough or recognise mistake or where we would have want thing to go well appreciate the statement he have make from the dispatch box but the fact that we be here be testament to the determination and sincere concern of member of both houses whatever benches they sit on they be deeply concerned that we must not miss this opportunity to find solution to such significant challenge our colleague in the other place have speak about their commitment to the primacy of this house and their reticence to delay the passage of this bill any far than be absolutely necessary their resolve demonstrate the importance of this issue to member of both houses and the stakeholder they represent the government have speak repeatedly of their commitment to protect the creative industry but their action be still yet to match their rhetoric it appear that review have today be upgrade to work group many excuse have be make for why the government feel unable to act now baroness kidron and other noble lords have act in good faith on the government state concern and have seek to address they in the late iteration of their transparency amendment on copyright and ai lords amendment would provide the government with flexibility to put in place proportionate regulation on the transparency of ai enterprise by reference to their size importantly it would allow reasonable timeframe for the government to complete their review of response to their consultation which conclude in february before the secretary of state be compel to lay draft transparency regulation before parliament for the third time an amendment on this topic receive the overwhelming support of member in the other place and the debate at the last round show that the strength of feeling be mirror in this house amendment be balanced clause that would put in place much need long stop date to provide the certainty that creative and the technology industry alike have be call for as the hon member for east thanet ms billington suggest it be backstop the government have run out of excuse for fail to act today we have an opportunity to achieve something relatively rare in our political climate create effective balanced legislation base on cross party compromise it be important to public confidence in government to show that we can put sound principle above politic when the overwhelming need arise the government have another opportunity today let we make sure that it be not another miss one call the liberal democrat spokesperson rise to speak to lords amendment as the bill return to this house be grateful that the other place continue to fight for creative and this amendment focus on the fundamental principle of transparency while secure the principle of proportionality be also grateful for the cross party work and support in this house and the movement from the secretary of state today know that many member have sign various amendment stand up for creative and call on colleague across the house to consider how they vote today on this amendment at its very core the amendment would require ai company to provide copyright owner with clear relevant information about how their work be be use for ai development and training the amendment be clear that it be for the trader or data holder to ensure that the data be accessible to copyright owner upon request behind that be real people real community and the rich tapestry of billion creative industry my constituency of stratford on avon have always be place where art and creativity flourish do my hon friend agree that government action be need now to ensure that our british artist musician and writer the william shakespeares of the future be fully protect and compensate by the big tech company thank my hon friend for that intervention indeed be go to say that every mp here will have local creative the secretary of state talk about the artist represent in his office in mine be tabitha mary who do picture of around town in harpenden and berkhamste we have musician such as rock chorus in hertfordshire we have film studio such as elstree warner bros leavesden and bovingdon and be that sure many of they will be follow this debate their life work their painting performance or film be feed into ai system right now and they have no way of know they want to work hand in hand with technology and ai but our creative be call for fair playing field this be just the tip of the iceberg be recently approach by the british deaf association with concern about ai company require vast volume of video footage of british sign language without proper consent or awareness from the original signer be curious about what an ai would say about the issue so ask it to write in the style of the hon member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant do not ask it for the secretary of state as the hon member for rhondda and ogmore be minister in the department for science innovation and technology and the department for culture media and sport think it would be quite interesting highlight that the ai say that the minister be know for his bold articulate style often weave sharp analysis with touch of wit but will let other be the judge of whether the ai have encapsulate that this be what it have to say lady and gentleman we stand at crossroad one where technology and creativity be collide not in conflict but in collaboration for century imagination have drive progress shape our world through art literature design and innovation and now ai be in the mix not to replace human ingenuity but to challenge it expand it and sometimes even surprise we the question be whether ai be come it here the real question be how do we harness it to elevate human creativity rather than diminish it it ask very good question to elevate that human creativity creative be call for transparency today we be at that crossroad with an opportunity to vote for that transparency as the bill near completion urge the government to accept this reasonable compromise accept that the tone and the movement today be welcome and that work with creative and tech be much need do the hon member agree that what that quote prove be that ai can not capture the wit and humour that my hon friend the member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant bring to this chamber and fashion and fashion in fact ai be poor copy of what my hon friend represent and bring think the house have speak on that true leadership in ai mean build on respect for creativity include in the house of commons not exploitation we can build an ai power future where technology and human ingenuity flourish together but only if we start with transparency we can be world leader in set standard for creative and technology to work together invite all colleague from all party to join we today in support amendment to set that direction and to stand up for transparency for our creator and for the principle that in the age of ai human creativity still matter this be the second time we have consider this amendment in this house and it be the second time we have receive this just trust just want to get on with it homily that all the ministerial team present when we discuss the matter they say they want to set up all sort of work group and that they want to get to legislation none of we have any difficulty with or objection to that but what we want be action now we get concerned when the secretary of state as he just do say that there be no certainty in our copyright law just now do not say that the secretary of state can check back in hansard that be exactly what he say and that be where the concern and anxiety come in the government might get technical victory today because of the invocation of financial issue but the bill will come back again from the house of lords they be not go to give up everybody be unite with the house of lords when it come to these issue everybody want solution now nobody agree with the government position except the ai firm that seek to benefit from the unauthorised use of our cultural work and the anger be grow the more the public see of this the more our constituent get increasingly concerned about how our artist be be treat we only need to look at sir elton john reaction on sunday not just the choice of language about the government front benchers but that he feel so dismiss he be even threaten legal action surely the way forward be compromise and the government go some way toward give the creative sector what they want lord amendment present that approach it respect the financial prerogative of this government and it have take on board everything that the front benchers have say urge the government to reconsider their position and to engage seriously on the substance of the amendment which would address copyright holder call for transparency without impose immediate enforcement cost it would require ai developer to provide copyright owner with clear relevant accurate and accessible information on how their work have be use and how they be access nothing could be fair than that the government use word like may rather than must thereby avoid direct spending obligation we must surely work together on the basis of what have be agree between both houses and try to ensure that we get something that meet everybody concern that have to start with this lords amendment urge the government to accept it at this really late stage and encourage labour back benchers who have make fantastic contribution today and who have stand up to this government to vote against they that will show exactly how strongly they feel about this issue encourage labour colleague to back the amendment have to say that be slightly surprised that no labour back bencher be willing to speak in support of the government position but it mean that have more time to speak than have initially think would be the case will not repeat the argument that we have have in the lengthy debate on these measure that have already take place but want to make one or two point in his contribution the secretary of state say that he have never mention the word uncertainty and imply that he think that copyright law be clear have to say that that contrast with an awful lot of the debate we have have previously in which his colleague the minister for the creative industries have talk about there be uncertainty the right hon member must have miss several of the debate in which expressly say that do not think there be any uncertainty about the law as it presently stand well the ministerial foreword to the consultation paper suggest there be uncertainty and that have consistently be one of the reason why the government have say they need to carry out all these consultation even if the law be clear as the secretary of state suggest personally believe it be clear the important thing be that it can only be enforce if those who have their copyright breach be aware that that have take place that be why transparency be of critical importance as know the government have acknowledge the secretary of state have say this afternoon that he be go to set up more work party our concern be that as the secretary of state have just say large amount of copyright material be already be scrap by generative ai his work party and further consultation we wait to hear when legislation might arrive mean that it will be another few year before we actually have this measure on the statute book there be an opportunity to have something on the statute book now and he will be aware that the exist provision the provision be simply be ignore they be not work and it be important that we act immediately to send very clear signal that we expect transparency to be in place and for generative ai company to properly remunerate licence holder want to mention some of the other provision on the order paper the government have say that lords amendment engage financial privilege the chair say that not we well the clerks may have merely suggest that it be very unclear as many in the house of lords have suggest it be very unclear how the amendment can engage financial privilege the amendment use the word may so it do not contain any requirement on the government to indulge in financial expenditure it be worrying precedent if the government be go to avoid debate on policy by suggest that order think it would be helpful if clarify that that be matter for the chair and not for the government accept your ruling madam deputy speaker it just look very strange to see that the amendment engage financial privilege when there be no financial requirement in the amendment will finish on one further point understand the secretary of state keenness to attract investment from tech company when we have previously debate legislation affect tech company on each occasion we have hear that it may result in their be unwilling to come and invest in this country but that have never be the case hope the secretary of state will not listen to those who say that if we proceed to enforce copyright law it may somehow result in tech company find this country unattractive do not believe that be the case and do not believe that it would jeopardise the job that the government be keen to create but unless we proceed down the route of accept the lords amendment we will jeopardise the job of the million people in this country who be employ in the creative industry

proceeding on the motion for this mcmorrin uk eu summit policy priorities business and trade committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the business and trade committee the chair of the business and trade committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention can be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not the relevant minister front benchers may take part in questioning rise to speak to the house today on behalf of the business and trade committee on our sixth report road map for the eu reset hope you will forgive madam deputy speaker for use this moment to share my profound thank to the member of the committee who be both diligent and hard work from our early day together as committee it be clear to we all that our relationship with the european union have be trap in the logic of the past and that although not all of that past be bitter the present be clearly unsatisfactory and the future could be rich if we collectively choose to reset that relationship with more ambition that we sense be also the analysis of his majesty government we ask ourselves what could be do to move this relationship forward not distract by fantasy but inform with real hard headed and pragmatic focus we travel to brussels belfast and geneva we listen to business trade union diplomat and official in the european commission we look at border post trade barrier and be afraid to say an awful lot of lose opportunity we ask one simple question how can we make these arrangement well we seek not to reopen old wound but to open new door what surprise we be that it be not difficult to find different way in which our relationship with the european union could be reset in manner that would make our country rich with step that would support our security deepen our energy tie and cut the red tape that be throttle trade with the eu these be not abstract aspiration they be ground practical and deliverable and they be support by an overwhelming coalition of business group that we meet in short the proposal we present be back by business because they be good for business and therefore good for our country we divide the work into three ambition first to defend our prosperity secondly to defend and advance energy co operation and thirdly to cut the red tape strangle trade at the border on security we propose bold new partnership joint defence industrial policy framework for protect critical national infrastructure and strong co ordination to tackle economic crime we call for close co operation at the world trade organisation include uk participation in the new dispute resolution procedure because rule base order be not just idealism for we it be insurance on energy we see something extraordinary an opportunity to unlock the potential of the north sea as the world big green energy power station that vision demand that we come together with the eu to create single carbon border adjustment mechanism and to connect again electricity trading and emission trading that could add up to fast and cheap path to net zero for both we and our european neighbour on trade we welcome the government ambition for deep sanitary and phytosanitary agreement and indeed fair fishery deal but we press for some specific mutual recognition of alternative economic operator scheme bilateral waiver for safety and security declaration co operation around roll on roll off ferry rejoin the pan euro mediterranean convention mutual recognition of conformity assessment and long term road map for compatible regulation on service we urge his majesty government to strike new data adequacy agreement pursue deep co operation on financial service ensure uk access to horizon europe framework programme sort out new road map for mutual recognition of professional qualification reduce the barrier for tour artist and implement visa base number cap age cap youth experience scheme we publish our draft report to test it the response be overwhelming with support level of between and for the measure that we propose business say this be what we need because it will unlock growth create job and raise wage on monday we see some sign that the government have listen we be glad to see progress on security defence electricity trading and emission alignment there be new security and defence pact there be useful language on critical national infrastructure there be welcome step towards join electricity and carbon market together there be however also much leave in the to do pile there be no iron clothe commitment to share defence industrial policy and there be too little progress on law enforcement co operation there be silence on wto co operation although acknowledge that may come in the trade strategy when it be publish we also think that there could have be more on financial service co operation datum adequacy and mutual recognition of conformity assessment this be deal without date handshake but not yet contract none the less it be an important start after year of drift and division this be the first time since brexit that collectively we have the chance to stop dig ditch of grievance and start rebuild some bridge of co operation this be step forward but it be only step what come next must be really clear we must now have timetable for draw up finalise and implement these agreement there should be action to take forward the unfinished business which we have set out in this report crucially we think there should be big role for parliament because parliament should not be bystander while our future be forge let we not retreat into nostalgia let we work pragmatically together in the national interest because that be how future be build we be at our good in this parliament when we choose to lead and that be exactly what this relationship now need commend to the house this report and its call to action do my right hon friend agree that consistency and clarity be exactly what business require to grow and thrive that be why the government should consider the report recommendation to consult with industry on rejoin the pan euro mediterranean convention pem membership could support tariff free trade simplify rule of origin and reduce trade barrier for key sector such as automotive manufacturing chemical and food production by join pem british business would expand its preferential market access to country thereby strengthen supply chain and boost the competitiveness of british export my hon friend make that point repeatedly during the committee deliberation what have be especially welcome be how she consistently bring the perspective of local business in her dudley constituency the home of the industrial revolution as we all know she be right that subject to consultation in particular around the implication for the electric vehicle industry rejoin the pem convention could deliver we some rule of origin that would radically cut red tape for many business in her constituency and across our country frankly it would also lower cost at time when that be much need thank the right hon gentleman and his committee for their extensive piece of work and for the report he have present today he mention the wide range of different ask that the uk government have and that he recommend that they pursue do he agree that it be disappointing that out of the area that the uk want to achieve agreement on movement for tour artist and participation in eu defence spending be leave unagreed while the uk government seem to have agree on and trade one of our most valuable area in the negotiation access to our fishing ground the hon lady will know as do that although fishery and the fishing industry constitute quite small part of our economy about of gdp for many coastal community it be vital industry nevertheless we feel certainly do that the prize of an sps agreement which could be worth huge boost of up to billion to billion year accord to aston university and that allow for shellfish export to the european market be potentially prize be worth have however the hon lady be right to say that the big concern that we should have have be defence industrial co operation we can not defend europe in the way that we should and we can not spend the increase in our defence spending in the way that we should unless we reorganise europe fragmented defence industrial base we can not be strong together unless we build that share defence base together very much hope that we will hear of progress on that in the strategic defence review and the national security review when those strategy be present to parliament before the summer recess our committee report cover how we can help agrifood business export to the eu and be delighted to see salmon scotland and the national farmers union scotland come out in support of the deal this week do my right hon friend agree that it be baffle to see the snp stand with reform and the tories in opposition to the deal the consensus when we publish the draft of our report be overwhelming and the measure we propose be back by an enormous majority of business group across the country include group across scotland what business see be practical hard headed common sense set of recommendation that should be support by not only the government but those in public life across our country thank the right hon member for his leadership and hard work on the committee welcome the move this week and the set of aspirational statement of intent that go in the right direction that be great but do he agree that we should focus on the big stuff proportionately the deal with india will get we of gdp growth by and the american pact take we to position that be bad than where we be six month ago so europe be where it be at europe represent of our trade versus with the us but of the beneficial recommendation that the committee set out maybe five or six have be hit the key thing be to go for the big stuff such as be back inside the custom union that would make big difference the report could not have be as well write or as strong and robust in its recommendation without the hon member input we be grateful for the hard work he put into get the report right as he know bespoke customs union be not proposal we make perhaps because it would not necessarily have sweep up the committee in unanimity what be strike be that the measure set out in the report would have be significant enough to offset the economic damage we will suffer because of the tariff introduce by president trump the hon member be right that in economic matter it be always wise to focus on the big number and the big number in trade come from well close strong relationship with the european union congratulate my right hon friend on his report and his stewardship of the committee my inbox be full of email from local business in redditch relieve that after year of hesitation and no progress we be finally in dialogue with the eu about improve access for business do he agree that as the report state by continuously speak to the eu we can finally start get rid of the red tape as be promise to business by many on the pro brexit side and get proper access to the market that world lead company in redditch really should be able to access freely my hon friend have consistently be strong voice for the business community in redditch since he join we in the house he be right that what have be lack for long time in the relationship with the european union be the kinetic energy require to drive any bureaucracy forward number of work group be set up because of the trade and co operation agreement in cross party spirit should say it be important to note that the mood in brussels change significantly under the last prime minister with the progress make in the windsor framework however unless significant amount of political attention and energy be invest thing will not move forward and there be still long way to go the committee have set out in the report where some of that progress still need to happen but ultimately politic be what change thing hope that the political energy that go into monday can be sustain for the future thank the right hon gentleman whose tremendously adroit chairmanship of the committee have allow lot of cross party working which have be really refreshing and very good this be moment of regret the committee do flag up how fragile coastal community could be damage badly by multi year deal on fishing and the year deal be beyond anything anybody imagine it will hammer fragile community right across britain and particularly in scotland that be unfortunate do he agree that achieve an sps deal must be balance with the deal with india america and so forth that be come down the track be sure the committee will look at this and that we must have due care for ensure that the brexit freedom that allow we to strike those deal be not damage the hon gentleman be right as we be compose the report for the house over the last few week he consistently underline the risk that coastal community would confront if the deal be to go the wrong way we be all incredibly grateful to he for the voice he provide we must ensure that we enshrine certain standard that allow we to draw close to europe without compromise the alliance already come into place and those that we still need to strike in order to restore our role as the great free trading nation on this planet the way in which the government seek to tessellate the agreement with the trade deal with the united states with our leadership of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership with the deal with india and with the deal that be still to come with the gulf co operation council korea and switzerland need to be very carefully balanced it look like the government have just about get it right however know that the hon gentleman like will want our committee to keep an extremely close eye on that as the trade talk proceed thank my right hon friend for this excellent report that be root in pragmatism and practical step which know my constituent welcome he have highlight gap as he see it it be first step and there be lot more to do will his committee undertake to monitor the gap between what the government have commit to and where he would like the government to be and will he and his committee continue to make recommendation to the government my hon friend be right to point that out the good news for the minister be that he now have the scrutiny framework in front of he that the committee will use to judge the progress that he make over the course of this parliament there be moment that be still to come for this parliament however at some point we be not quite sure when scrub treaty will need to be lay in this house this house will then enjoy the grand total of day during the constitutional reform and governance act process in which to scrutinise they that be not very long the committee have therefore decide this week that we will open inquiry on the eu india and united states deal we will seek to hold hearing on each of those trade deal before the summer so that the house can be as well inform as possible when the crag process begin and we can zero in on the issue that be at stake for our constituent be grateful to the chair of the business and trade committee for this thorough set of proposal and especially for the call for great role for parliament the committee red amber and green rat its proposal and mark as green the uk eu security pact yet the prime minister spokesman admit this be first step towards uk participation in europe defence investment progression and go on to say that it merely open the door towards joint procurement will the committee chair acknowledge how much more there be to do before this amount to share defence industrial base the hon member be absolutely right he know because of the extraordinary record of service that he bring to this house that there be an immense amount of work that we still need to do to conquer the inefficiency and fragmentation of the european defence industrial base we can not spend the money that we propose to spend on defence wisely unless we change the way that we procure military equipment on the one hand that will provide great certainty and long term contract to defence supplier and on the other it will help ensure that we be build an innovative ecosystem of funding to help small innovative nimble and agile supplier of weaponry to come forward in the way that they can to ensure that the lesson that we have learn on the battlefield of ukraine inform our military strategy in future if there be one lesson that we have learn it be that any warfighting capability depend on the strength of our defence industrial base quite obviously today defence industrial base in europe be not in the right place and together with our partner we have to work hard on that hope that the strategic defence review will set out some practical step for how we will do that together with our ally in europe congratulate the right hon gentleman on his statement and on the work of his committee clearly renewable energy be an important part of our relationship with the european union what opportunity do his committee have to examine that and the trade of energy between the uk and the european union particularly in the light of the possibility in the near future of an interconnector between morocco and the uk by way of the uk morocco power project or xlink he may know that if the uk do not greenlight that in the near future other european country certainly will the right hon member be absolutely right to say that morocco be country that we should work more closely with xlink be an exciting proposal as stable long term partner to europe morocco be country with which we have share interest in the future the perspective that we bring to the question be on how we can ensure fast cheap and less risky path to net zero for we and for europe we hear strike evidence from many in the electricity and energy sector about almost the thoughtless way that we have be disconnect from electricity trading scheme what really worry we in the near term be that give different carbon price in the uk and europe if europe introduce carbon border adjustment mechanism and we do little later on almost tariff wall would be create we think the government have do well in seize that win win but that be not to take anything away from the logic and force of the hon member remark ultimately we will need several big infrastructure initiative if we be to do what we all know need to be do in this country to drive down industrial electricity price mental health bill legislative scrutiny joint committee on human rights select committee statement the hon member for bracknell peter swallow will speak for up to minute during which no intervention will be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not speech emphasise that question must be direct to the select committee member and not the relevant minister and front benchers may take part in questioning it be an honour to present to the house the joint committee on human rights report into the mental health bill as member will know the joint committee be cross party body of both houses chair by lord alton of liverpool whose remit be to examine matter relate to human right within the uk include through legislative scrutiny over the course of our inquiry into the bill we have examine legal framework and witness submission and crucially hear from those with direct experience of the mental health system as part of our inquiry the committee convene roundtable with individual who have experience detention under the mental health act their testimony be powerful candid and often harrowing they speak of the trauma of be section the overuse of medication and restraint and the disempowerment from be detain in facility that too often feel isolate rather than therapeutic participant have since share with we how important this visibility be to they to see their evidence truly listen to and share publicly hear directly from people with live experience be not just informative it be essential these conversation ground our scrutiny in the reality face by patient and family the insight share at that roundtable shape our thinking and sharpen our final recommendation as one participant tell we live experience matter use it to inform policy should be the standard not shock take this opportunity to thank all those who contribute to the roundtable often at the cost of revisit past trauma the committee be also grateful for the expert work of the committee legal counsel particularly alex gask who lead on this work as well as thiago simoes froio and hafsa saeed who lead on the delivery of the roundtable event it become clear over the course of our scrutiny just how overdue the mental health bill have become it will introduce substantial change to the mental health act which provide the legal framework for the detention and compulsory treatment of people with mental outdated term but one that remain part of our law the change introduce by the bill will bring our mental health legislation into the century strengthen patient right and help end practice that bring more harm than good when people hear about detention under the mental health act many instinctively think of those who have commit the most serious and violent crime they picture high security hospital such as broadmoor which happen to be locate in my constituency have have the opportunity to visit broadmoor the work they do there be outstanding it be vital world lead work that deal with some of the most complex and challenging case in psychiatric medicine let we be clear though the reality of detention under the mental health act be not limit to high security hospital or individual convict of serious crime many people detain under the act be not criminal many of they be child young people and adult with autism or learning disability who be detain not because they pose danger to other but because the support they need in their community simply be not there this be not just inefficient it can often be deeply traumatise and raise significant human right concern that be why the committee welcome the major change introduce by the government bill it will end the detention of individual under section of the mental health act solely on the basis that they be autistic or have learn disability tighten the criterion for detention and require decision maker to consider the nature degree and likelihood of harm before decide to detain introduce the concept of nominate person to replace the outdated near relative system and remove police station and prison as place of safety for individual in crisis as state in the evidence we receive from witness those be important welcome and long await reform they reflect the breadth of the government consultation and prove that the government listen to the information they receive while welcome the bill direction of travel the committee believe that there be area where the government could go even far to provide enhanced protection for human right that be why base on the evidence we receive during the inquiry we have recommend few key amendment first we recommend new clause to ensure that child detain under the mental health act be accommodate on adult ward only when that be demonstrably in their good interest secondly we recommend an amendment to clause to include equity as fifth guide principle under the act this would refer specifically to address inequality in treatment and outcome on racial ground in particular and welcome the health secretary say on second reading of the bill on monday people from ethnic minority community especially black african and caribbean man be more than three time as likely to be section official report may vol in our report we find that add equity as guide principle would do more to address racial disparity thirdly we recommend an amendment to clause to shorten the review period for restricted patient who be discharge into condition amount to the deprivation of liberty the first review will be require within six month rather than and subsequent review will take place annually rather than every two year those key amendment come amid range of other recommendation recent case law show that mental health patient in state commission and fund but privately provide care do not come within the protection of the human rights act that loophole must be close and we recommend that the government do just that we also hear evidence that the question of when the mental health act and when the mental capacity act should govern patient deprivation of liberty and treatment be far too complex and raise human right concern not least because deprive person of their liberty on any ground can be justify only if the legal basis be clear we therefore recommend that the government carry out an urgent review and provide the clarity that be currently lack on this question another crucial area the bill cover be the right of child who be particularly vulnerable when assess or treat under the mental health act many of the propose change to the law will be positive for child include the introduction of an opt out approach to receive report from independent mental health advocate but we recommend that the government consult on introduce statutory test for assess whether be competent to consent or to refuse consent to treatment cornerstone of compliance with child human right the committee also deem it vital that prisoner whose mental health make hold they in prison unsuitable be transfer promptly to an appropriate setting keep they in prison may result in human right breach in our report we welcome the introduction in the bill of statutory day timeframe for hospital transfer relevant datum should be collect and make available to monitor and help to ensure compliance with that standard the committee welcome change to restriction order place on small number of offender detain under hospital order but the government should consider introduce more prompt and regular review by the mental health tribunal to ensure that any loss of liberty be justify witness tell we that in the absence of effective support in the community autistic people and people with learning disability could still end up in unjustified detention on other legal basis the government have state that the change in the bill will come into force only where there be strong community service in place but it be vital that this do not delay the much need reform we therefore welcome the government commitment to provide write ministerial statement annually to both houses of parliament set out progress to date on implementation on what more the bill could do to improve the prospect of patient receive timely care in the community we also ask the government to consider introduce an english equivalent to the right to mental health assessment that apply in wales the report make it clear that much more be need to fix the broken mental health system in this country and know the government recognise that as well this be small targeted bill which will not change everything but the change it will introduce be significant and long overdue the government have commit to introduce mental health expert in every school to set up young futures hub and to recruit more mental health staff by focus on community base intervention and drive down waiting list for mental health support alongside the welcome change in the bill we can turn the tide and fix our broken mental health system so that the human right of all those with mental health need be properly protect and they can get the support they need commend this report to the house call the shadow minister commend the hon member for bracknell peter swallow and his committee for the report we on the opposition benches will be look favourably at it especially as the bill go into committee have one technical question he talk about restraint for people who have autism and learn disability currently the timetable for work out whether they have mental health disorder or it be relate to their condition be day do his committee look at that from human right perspective to see whether it be the right time in which to make that assessment we do look at whether the process for assess people be appropriate and that issue come up it be one where the individual human right be exercise and we must strike careful balance between the need to protect they and those around they and to ensure that the deprivation of liberty be only ever last resort off the top of my head seem to remember that the report find that the balance currently strike be appropriate albeit it be one that the government should look at if have get that wrong will happily correct the record congratulate the hon member on his committee report be really interested in the point he make about an english equivalent to the right to mental health assessment in wales with admission to acute mental health setting increase year by year do he agree that it could drastically improve admission if we be to introduce such equivalence for england and do not wait until crisis point for people particularly young people to get the support they need my hon friend make really good point it be vital as we have see across health education and the justice system that we get back to have laser like focus on early intervention because we know that the early we intervene the well it be for all involve as he suggest improve our mental health system through the measure recommend in the report would mean that we do not get to crisis point where individual have to be section under the mental health act instead community support which we know work when it be there can be use to provide these individual with the help they need be grateful to the joint committee for this report note the committee call for more prompt and regular review by the mental health tribunal the basis for that call be compliance with the individual right to liberty but do the hon member agree that regular review by the tribunal be also in the interest of the family and neighbour of mental health patient give how disruptive and upsetting it can be for they to have patient live in the community absolutely we hear through our reporting of family be in real distress particularly where child be in treatment and where treatment be happen long way away from where the family live make access to the family member even more difficult the hon member point be really important of course our committee be scrutinise this bill through the lens of human right though it be important to we as say in my statement that we hear from those with live experience of the mental health system to inform our recommendation he make powerful point backbench business access to nhs dentistry beg to move that this house have consider access to nhs dentistry thank the backbench business committee for grant time for this debate and the colleague who support that application be pleased that many member want to speak and be aware of the limitation on time so will keep my remark brief during the general election labour promise to tackle the lack of nhs dental service and welcome the progress already make in the labour government first month after year of neglect we be finally start to see action to address the crisis in nhs dental care include the launch of extra urgent dental appointment with my own integrate care board in humber and north yorkshire deliver of they across the region this government be rightly focus on prevention by roll out much need supervise tooth brush scheme in school that be small intervention with long term benefit particularly for child grow up in area like mine where level of tooth decay be among the high in england currently one in three five year old in deprive area experience tooth decay shocking statistic that simply must be address over people have sign petition lead by the british dental association the women institute and the daily mirror call on the government to urgently deliver on their promise to reform nhs dentistry and the demand could not be more urgent catherine one of many constituent who have write to about dental provision have be with her dentist for over decade but during the pandemic miss appointment simple miss appointment that be cancel by the surgery itself see she remove from her regular appointment and she have since be unable to join another practice be tell that waiting list would take at least two year in the meantime she suffer devastating deterioration to her oral health lose all of her back tooth suffer with an infected crown and bridge and face the real fear of lose her top tooth too and catherine be only in her she be quote privately for treatment she simply can not afford that she have have to endure constant pain that no one should be leave to bear constituent regularly tell that they can not find an nhs dentist take new patient they be call every single practice list on the nhs website and they be get nowhere people be live in pain they be miss work and their mental health be suffer some people be even attempt their own dental work and we can not allow that to become the norm the desire for action be also support by dental practice in my constituency one of they tell we see high need patient we ve never treat before often for complex work but we do this use the same budget we ve have for year in fact some of the new urgent care and school base initiative be not additionally fund the bda most recent figure show that dentist in england be deliver the least nhs care of all four uk nation only of dentist in england be spend most of their time on nhs work compare with nearly in scotland practice be deliver nhs treatment at loss they lose over for every denture fit and nearly for every new patient they see this labour government pledge to reform the dental contract it be in our manifesto it be part of the plan that we be elect on welcome the early sign of recovery but when we say that we want to go far fast it be precisely on issue like this that the public be look to government to deliver in great grimsby and cleethorpes and across the nation we be privileged to have so many dedicated dental professional tomorrow be visit dental design studio to celebrate its year of high quality dental care provision in cleethorpes it be real credit to the team there who have deliver consistent care to local people often under increase strain and our young people be not forget locally thank to the commitment of dr jatinder ubhi from dentology multiple young people in my constituency have receive essential dental support we must not let dentistry become luxury service only for those who can afford to go private we need new approach that be fair that fund dentist properly and that deliver accessible care to everyone who need it rise order because so many member wish to contribute and we have to conclude by pm we will have time limit of three minute start from now call sir julian lewis who think can manage that think you can do it thank you madam deputy speaker for that no pressure introduction congratulate the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn on her speech and agree with every part of it be hop to quote from individual case raise by constituent and from the local women institute but all that will have to go by the board have wonderful briefing from the british dental association and in the remain two and half minute would like to make one pertinent observation from which everything else flow dentistry be highly skilled profession in which practitioner can charge colossal sum of money in private practice which give they financial incentive to steer clear of work for the nhs that be the root of the problem on march put question to the secretary of state for health and social care about point make by the darzi report last september which say there be enough dentist in england just not enough dentist willing to do enough nhs work which impact provision for the poor in society be pleasantly surprised when his reply be nhs dentistry be in terrible state and in fact in many part of the country it barely exist there be lot of reason for that and it be source of constant astonishment to that the dentistry budget be underspent year after year despite that situation official report march vol in reality as the bda point out the reason why that budget be underspent be not because of the lack of demand but because nhs practice can not fill vacancy and be unable to meet contractual commitment therefore those who do work with and for the nhs be have to deliver dental care at loss there be fundamental requirement for rewrite constitution and contract by which it become worthwhile for people to practice dentistry in the nhs because otherwise we will see two tier society in which only the rich can get the dental care that people so desperately need when the nhs be introduce it make the big positive change ever to the health of the general population the original how to use your nhs booklet from state it will provide you with all medical dental and nursing care everyone rich or poor man woman or child can use it or any part of it on the topic of dentistry it say after july you can go to any dentist take part in the new arrangement there will be list at your post office at that time of register dentist sign up to work in the nhs currently in england approximately be sign up to work in the nhs significant reduction since the early day that demonstrate clear barrier to access as former nhs manager in scotland have see the importance of early intervention when it come to health inequality particularly in dentistry scotland too have an access crisis with decrease number of nhs participate dentist naturally those low level of participation affect patient access to nhs dental service and dentist lose the chance to pick up early sign of decay cancer and other serious issue which result in high cost for the nhs and bad outcome for patient additionally child and adult from the most deprived area be less likely than their wealthy counterpart to have see their dentist within the last two year recent statistic from public health scotland show that of child from the most deprived area have see their dentist in the last two year compare with for child in the least deprive area those figure drop to and for adult in september the gap in child participation between the most and least deprive area be three percentage point that increase to seven percentage point by percentage point in and then percentage point in we can not let that continue as oral health inequality continue to grow it be important that our nhs strategy involve focus on increase participation and access in more deprive area otherwise we will continue to see further such worrying trend which cause more serious problem far down the line rise call ben maguire interruption call dr andrew murrison thank you madam deputy speaker prefer ben have never enjoy andrew but andrew will do quite honestly nhs dentist be saint as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis have say the reason why we do not have any nhs dentist be that it be far more remunerative to do expensive dental work than the sort of grind service work that nhs dentistry imply the reason for that fundamentally be the so call new dental contract introduce in that be the problem unit of dental activity have plague the dental profession and the provision of nhs dentistry all these year be delighted that the government be revise the dental contract that their labour predecessor introduce year ago but unless they be prepared to underwrite it be afraid that we will still be more or less in the same position it be not as if we be not train dentist we be train more and more dentist and there be more and more dental school and rightly so but if those professional be go to practice in the nhs they need to be incentivise to do so agree with the right hon gentleman about the nhs dentistry contract which clearly need revision why do his party not do that in year in government be sorry that the hon gentleman have destroy the consensual way in which be try to introduce my remark if may will explain that think there have be conspiracy of silence all these year on nhs dentistry what government have to get to grip with be whether they intend that dentistry should continue to be universal part of our nhs and whether it will be exempt from the universality that have characterise the provision of healthcare service in this country since the government could decide that dentistry be bit like ophthalmic optic which in the be deliberately exclude from nhs provision be not recommend that but be recommend to the minister that we be at least honest with the public at the moment we have this pretence around nhs dentistry that say of course you have the right to have your tooth fix at no cost to you at all up front in reality in most part of the country mine include that be complete fiction when the government come to their new arrangement which welcome very much can we first have some honesty can we have some money behind they can we have some idea about what part of current nhs provision the government intend to deprioritise if that be their intention to ensure that we have truly universal provision of nhs dentistry go forward thank my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure this debate today mark year since the general election be call over the two and half year before then be out knock on door and listen to people across the filton and bradley stoke constituency as still do almost every weekend one of the issue raise with the most be how hard it have become to find and keep an nhs dentist listen and act on what matter locally take that campaign up raise those local issue with the then shadow health secretary who kindly raise they here in the house of commons for we before the election still there be no change from the conservatives who vote against labour plan to rescue nhs dentistry and remarkably continue to do nothing conservative failure be far from deterrent run survey ask local people what their experience be thank fellow resident who take the time to complete it and the finding be clear only of those who complete my survey have an nhs dentist but almost everyone without an nhs one notably of those without an nhs dentist say that it be because theirs go private and nearly all that labour plan to open up more urgent appointment year where they be most need would help still no action come from the conservatives and local people vote for change my very first question in this house be about ensure we have the right infrastructure as our community grow include dentist live locally know how challenging this have become do not have an nhs dentist either while receive official designation as dental desert be not something anyone want for their community be relieved that we finally have government who recognise the challenge we face this labour government action mean that across our integrate care board area we will now have an extra urgent nhs dental appointment and know this will be just the beginning the government will reform the dental contract and examine how we can encourage more dentist to stay within the nhs get we back to that place where people can again pop that dentist appointment back on the calendar whether they like go or not will not stand for future where as many as six in child have rot tooth by the age of five as they do in the britain we have inherit will not stand for future where the most common reason why child be admit to hospital be tooth decay as it be in the britain we have inherit will continue to campaign for good access to nhs dentist across my community for as long as it take and be glad to finally have government who can work with rather than have to fight against to get the nhs dental service we need locally since be elect to represent horsham have be approach by many resident face impossible price for urgent dental treatment annie be and care for husband with terminal bowel cancer you would think that she have enough thing to worry about but give the state of dental service in the horsham area she have be unable to find an nhs dentist within mile radius force to go private she pay for an assessment and be then quote for an extraction she ask simply when will an alternative to private dentistry be available also hear from sally her family be deny nhs root canal treatment with an private option as the only alternative she ask how can we trust their advice when it feel like it all about the money of course this be crisis not of dentist but of dentistry the nhs contract base as it be on unit of dental activity be simply no long fit for purpose if it ever be the conflict of interest between public and private be the result of more and more dentist be force to subsidise their nhs contract through private work the government have commit to provide more support and more urgent appointment but it be hard to get enough new employee through the front door when so many continue to leave by the back door in the area cover by my local integrate care board there be more people leave than join across many key dental role over six month period to the end of march last year there be general dentist in and out one orthodontist in and two out dental nurse in and out and receptionist in and out in fact five out of nine role in dentist clinic have be lose staff fast than they can get new one the result be ever decline access to nhs dental service with child lose their tooth before they even reach the age of and the horror story of do it yourself dental treatment will leave the house with the word of the west sussex local dental committee which contact just week after my election last year regard the nhs dental contract its warning be simple if we do act quickly there may be very little nhs leave to adopt new nhs contract accept that the present government be not responsible for cause this problem but they be responsible for fix it crisis have unfold in norfolk quietly but painfully crisis that we can afford to ignore no long it be the urgent and worsen state of nhs dentistry just of adult in norfolk have see an nhs dentist over the past two year well below the national average of for child the picture be even bad only have be see compare with nationally visit due to dental problem be rise in the east of england there have be visit per people that be bad than london the south east and the midland the only region do bad than we be the south west we now have just dentist in norfolk and waveney with any nhs activity down from in that be one dentist for every people one of my constituent recently ring with swollen face from an infected tooth they contact six emergency dentist but could not be see by single one they be force to go private pay more than that simply be not good enough in modern society my hon friend be set out eloquently why we need to improve dentistry do he agree that today access crisis be the result of decade of underfunding and contract failure in basingstoke as in his constituency two third of adult and nearly half of child do not see dentist last year do he believe this go beyond postcode lottery and be in fact systemic failure my hon friend make an extremely good point as though he have read the next part of my speech the secretary of state have describe our area as the sahara of dental desert agree but we need more than just diagnosis we need solution urge the government to invest in new dental school in the edith cavell medical campus in south norfolk we need to train dentist where they be need and keep they there also encourage all dentist to complete the government new survey before june insight must lead to reform start with the broken nhs dental contract norfolk have be take for grant for too long our county be ready for change and know that my hon friend will work together to deliver it because only by work together can we unlock the dental revolution that we need across norfolk it be an honour to speak in this debate and to raise the plight of my constituent some of whom be struggle in silence pain and frustration simply try to access basic nhs dental care thank the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure the debate and share her view on pretty much everything she have say but in particular the wide impact of poor dentistry on the nhs more widely and cardiac health have many constituent testimony to refer to today let begin with the real story of person who have work tirelessly her entire life now due to long covid she be housebound and dependent when she miss single nhs dental appointment due to illness she be remove from the list she have since be unable to find another nhs dentist when an infection strike she wait week for emergency care at st richard hospital and she be not alone in only of adult in the south east be see by an nhs dentist in the previous two year the second low rate in england in some area few than one in five adult have be able to access nhs dentistry the government have announce recent step with additional urgent care dental appointment for sussex rise from to week we have golden hello relocation incentive to attract dentist to underserve area some of those post have be approve for sussex welcome those step but they be not enough the dental defence union and the public accounts committee have make it clear as have other colleague that the nhs contract be break it disincentivise dentist from treat those patient with the great need in of dentist survey feel wear out and report burnout they be walk away from nhs dentistry not out of disinter but because the system be unsustainable how many of the urgent contract be now available and when will real contract reform take place thank my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure the debate for far too long people across the country have struggle to access nhs dental care and have hear heartbreaking story in my constituency one constituent have struggle to find an nhs dentist which have leave he without access to the denture he need he tell all want be to return to work as have always work but have no upper tooth be hold back as be so embarrassed poor dental health should not be barrier to individual return to work and my constituent situation be unacceptable it simply should not happen however there be glimmer of hope this government announcement of extra urgent dental appointment be vital step forward and nearly of those appointment will be deliver in greater manchester include for resident in leigh and atherton who have be wait for far too long it be sign of intent and recognition that action be overdue but for all this to work we need the workforce in place and that be where the challenge remain railway road dental practice in leigh have be try to replace senior dentist for nearly nine year despite advertising there have be no interest it be clear sign that practice particularly in area of high deprivation need well support to attract and retain staff the government golden hello scheme be smart move as it offer financial incentive to bring dentist into the area that need they most through the nhs long term workforce plan we be increase dental training place by as the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis say we must acknowledge the people who have keep nhs dentistry go through difficult time pay tribute to mr dobranski local dentist who have give year of his life to the nhs his service to the people of leigh be nothing short of remarkable and sincerely thank he for it yes the challenge be big but be encourage by the step be take the extra appointment the investment in the workforce and the renew focus on prevention be all sign that we be finally face up to the crisis congratulate the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn on secure the debate be delighted to be able to support her application because this issue deeply affect my constituent dentistry be in crisis nationally and nowhere be that feel more so than in rural community such as west dorset in my constituency we have just dental practice offer any form of nhs dental care serve population of more than have to confess that rather envy my hon friend for have dental practice as have mere nine in fact as become evident in the public accounts committee inquiry which attend as committee member minehead have few dentist than anywhere else in the united kingdom it be really important that we carry on lobby the integrate care board because they can give out contract know that my hon friend constituency suffer from lot of the same issue as west dorset give their similarity the consequence of the lack of nhs dental care be stark only of adult in west dorset have see dentist in the past two year and just of child have have dental appointment in that time an alarming low than in know that the government have announce rescue plan to provide more urgent dental appointment and to recruit new dentist to the area that need they most that be welcome news but how exactly be the area with the most need be assess what specific provision be be make to ensure that rural area such as west dorset where the population density be low but unmet demand be high be not leave behind once again in devon we have budget of to recruit new dentist sadly only two of the dentist have actually be recruit do my hon friend agree that this demonstrate that the conservatives golden hello scheme have completely fail and that we desperately need new contract now my hon friend be right that lot of this come down to the funding model when funding be allocate under the current model it be always rural community that lose out ask that the rurality of place such as west dorset be recognise in both the workplace planning and the resource allocation because the south west have the high rate of dental relate per people that be one in every people turn to emergency care because they can not get an nhs dentist appointment preventable oral health issue be flood our hospital because we have fail to resource our community dental service the government have make some minor tweak to the dysfunctional nhs contract which be welcome but morale be at an all time low over of dentist in england be think of leave the nhs all together the current contract often leave dentist lose money on every nhs patient they see for example typical dentist lose per denture fit that be unsustainable and it be time to reform the system as whole because change can not wait ask the government to come forward with clear timeline for negotiate on contract reform and to properly support integrate care board as my hon friend the member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour say with ringfenced funding for dental service the liberal democrats be call for comprehensive dental rescue package that would guarantee access to an nhs dentist for everyone in need of urgent or emergency care it would also ensure nhs dental check up for those already eligible include child pregnant woman new mother and people on low income in addition the package would guarantee that anyone begin chemotherapy undergo transplant or face critical treatment receive the essential dental assessment that they need beforehand would like the government to reverse the cut to public health grant which have fall by in real term since to restore funding for preventive oral health programme to expand supervised toothbrushing for child in school and nursery and to scrap the vat on child toothbrush and toothpaste ask the government to act now on behalf of my constituent and all rural community ask that community such as mine in west dorset be not treat as an afterthought in the funding model but be give priority thank my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure this vital debate this issue touch on every community but will focus on how the crisis be play out in my constituency amber valley have less than quarter of the national average number of nhs dentist per people when speak to resident on the doorstep and in my surgery hear the same heartbreaking story from people in pain who be unable to access an nhs appointment some have become so desperate that they have resort to pull out their own tooth during my campaign make promise to the people of amber valley to fight for well access to nhs dental care and that remain my most urgent pledge we do have handful of dedicated hard work dentist who be maintain nhs patient list against difficult odd dentist such as dr nadia duarte at amber valley dental practice but most surgery simply do not have the resource to keep their nhs list open this put huge pressure on the few that do with waiting list stretch over two year simply put anyone be extremely lucky to get an nhs appointment in amber valley amber valley dentist have tell that our surgery receive the low payment per nhs treatment when compare with neighbouring constituency this have make it almost impossible to recruit and retain the quality nhs staff we need take this up with the derbyshire integrate care board say not just that this be unfair but that it have create crisis of health inequality for amber valley be grateful that it listen and act we have secure an additional to address this underpayment allow our surgery in amber valley to take on more nhs staff and make it easy for we to get the nhs appointment we need it be real win for amber valley but nothing less than my constituent deserve although it be only small part of the solution and one that will take time to bear fruit that be why particularly welcome the government commitment to additional emergency nhs dental appointment each year and urge my constituent to access one of the such appointment in derbyshire promise the people of amber valley that would speak up for they and fight for the dental care that should be their right so although be grateful for the progress the government have make so far say to my hon friend the minister please let we go far and fast so that no one in amber valley have to suffer without the dental care they need thank the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for introduce this debate thornbury and yate be dental desert accord to recent newspaper report not single dentist in thornbury and yate be take on new nhs patient for the third year in row leave people have to travel long distance for care or force to pay for private treatment be sure as fellow south west mp the minister will be as concerned as be to hear that in september the nhs dental activity delivery rate be low in the south west at compare to the high in london at not surprisingly in the south west around one in every people have to be take to with dental problem in that be substantially high than in london where the figure be only one in every people the area cover by the nhs bristol north somerset and south gloucestershire integrated care board be the bad of all world with few dentist adjust for population size and low dental activity delivery rate alongside high number of visit with dental problem want to highlight two case that show the impact that be have on vulnerable people one constituent write despite contact more than dozen dental practice in and around south gloucestershire and bristol have be tell by every single surgery that no nhs appointment be available however have be offer private appointment if be willing to pay the situation be even more distressing as my wife be currently pregnant and require urgent dental care which be crucial for her health and that of our unborn child pregnant woman be entitle to free nhs dental care yet this right be render meaningless when no nhs appointment be available another constituent write to cancer patient who need major dental treatment ahead of intense radiotherapy bristol dental hospital advise they they would need lifelong follow up care but during covid that treatment be stop and they be discharge back to their nhs dentist soon after surprise surprise the practice cease to provide nhs dentistry and they could not find another so they be force to pay for their essential treatment there seem to be consensus across the house that the nhs dental contract be break that be the consensus across the country as well include in my constituency if there be one thing we can get out of the debate today it be timeline to which the government will commit to fix the situation and to bring legislation before the house do my hon friend agree that would be of benefit do we also need solution for people like my constituent in the meantime they have already have to pay for treatment and they face another worth of work to be able to eat normally that be stiff fee when you be reliant on personal independence payment and your spouse pension my constituent feel that they have nowhere to turn to sum up patient like my constituent deserve access to an nhs dentist we need an emergency scheme to guarantee access to free nhs dental check up for those already eligible child new mother those who like my constituent wife be pregnant and those on low income we need dental rescue package that bring dentist back into the nhs from the private sector by fix the dental contract and use flexible commissioning to meet patient need in the meantime anyone who have have severe toothache know the unbearable agony in those moment it feel like there be nothing bad but imagine watch your four year old child suffer that same pain and be tell that he can not be help that be the reality for my constituent louise single mum louise get in touch with when she be at break point she have to watch her son suffer through constant distress cry in agony unable to sleep and refuse his food when she manage to see an emergency dentist she be tell he would need between four and eight tooth extract under local anaesthetic but the wait time for that procedure be up to two year louise be leave with no choice but to manage her son pain with daily calpol and ibuprofen that be not healthcare it be abandonment sadly louise story be not rare in my constituency of blackpool south people be be drive to desperate measure they be turn up at in agony because they can not get dental appointment some be even resort to pull out their own tooth at home diy dentistry in century britain nhs dentistry be leave to decay under the previous government stand over there on the opposition benches one year ago today highlight the problem we have in blackpool in blackpool south just of adult have see an nhs dentist in the last two year that be sharp fall from over few year ago and well below the national average only of child be see in the past year figure that be low than almost anywhere else in england people live in poverty be most at risk of poor dental health and in my constituency poverty be daily reality for so many child tooth decay be one of the clear sign of how deep this crisis run in blackpool one in five three year old and nearly one in three five year old have visible dental decay among the high rate in the country behind every number be child miss class because of dental pain and parent like louise who feel helpless all this in town that already face some of the deep health inequality in the country be pleased that the government have roll out more urgent dentist appointment and know the government be commit to recruit new dentist in area that need they most like blackpool welcome the government commitment to reform the dental contract but urge they to act now the bda point out that reform service will not work if there be no workforce leave by the time it be finally introduce the sector need clear timetable for negotiation firm deadline for new system and sustainable funding model the government need to build system not on crisis care but on prevention and early access and it have never be more urgent people in blackpool south be not ask for special treatment they be just ask for treatment and the simple assurance that toothache will not become trauma be grateful to the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure this debate the application for which be pleased to support would like to tell the house about philip who write to in his own word in desperation he be proud armed force veteran and be recover from recent surgery for lung cancer when he suffer fall which cause he to lose number of his tooth after his maxillofacial surgery he be horrify to discover that there be no dentist take nhs patient near he and his previous dentist have simply remove he from their system he need denture not just for cosmetic reason but to be able to eat proper meal and be face future without any of this support case like philip will ring true be sure for far too many people here and indeed across my constituency be pleased to say that in this instance my team and get straight on the case and be able to help philip to secure an nhs appointment with local dentist early this week we look forward to see he with full smile again soon however we can not do that for the two third of my constituent who be not see an nhs dentist and nor should we have to we need to fix the broken system that be let down people in north norfolk one exciting prospect on the horizon be the establishment of dental school at the university of east anglia as my near neighbour the hon member for south norfolk ben goldsborough have already mention the school have support from member of all party in norfolk and we be excited for norfolk to start training and place its own dentist in the come year however the university of east anglia need funding for place from the government confirm before may in order to appear in the ucas application for student begin in september but the treasury have demand that any such spending not be confirm until the spending review in few week time for the sake of less than six week of bureaucracy my constituent face yet another full year of delay nevertheless be pleased that it be confirm this week that cromer will have an expand dental practice that will take on new nhs patient the lib dem lead north norfolk district council have work to secure new lease with the dental design studio on the former tourist information centre the new practice will have five surgery all at ground level to improve accessibility after year of decline we may finally be see the green shoot of improvement in north norfolk part of the dental desert be pleased to have the opportunity today to stand up for everyone who have struggle with our crumble system over the past few year for people like philip for the many child face tooth decay for all those on waiting list and for those force to fork out for private treatment thing must improve and they can will be fight hard to ensure that they do nhs dentistry have be recur theme for both before the election and since as know be true for most colleague which be why this labour government have make it priority however we be start from very difficult place let set out just how bad the situation be in morecambe and lunesdale last year knock on the door of man in morecambe who have lose most of his tooth because he do not have access to dental care just yesterday constituent write to ask to speak in this debate she and her husband travel more than mile four time year just to see their nhs dentist they be retire and can not afford to go private and like many old people they need regular and more complex care we do not have to look far to see the root of the problem so to speak dentist have be tell we for year that the nhs dental contract be not fit for purpose the contract create perverse incentive dentist be discourage from treat the patient who need they the most appreciate that this be partly because in the and early the contract incentivise the over treating of patient but now the pendulum have swing back too far the other way and we have to find balanced approach dental decay be one of the lead cause of hospital admission in child in over child end up in hospital need their tooth remove the government have an historic commitment to prevention birmingham erdington be one of the young constituency in the country do my hon friend agree that we must continue to build on supervised brushing and target fluoride application in early year setting to protect the youngster my hon friend be absolutely right prevention be always well than cure when sit on lancashire county council health scrutiny committee we take evidence that show that thing such as supervised brushing and help with fluoride be some of the most cost effective intervention and they could prevent the horror of child go into hospital for preventable tooth removal dental health have become stark marker of inequality without ongoing care and access to that preventive care child in less well off family be more likely to suffer worsen dental problem the contract be major problem it lock in those perverse incentive but the situation be then worsen by over decade of neglect of all area of public health under the previous government too many family do not go to the dentist until it be too late and it be very expensive so we need those preventive measure that my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington speak about and we need access to nhs dentist we know that if people be not able to go to the dentist it mean they turn up at but they be send away with painkiller and antibiotic and that do not fulfil their need be pleased that our government be take this issue seriously be pleased that we recognise the scale of the problem and be pleased that we be take action not only on nhs dentistry but on preventive care we owe it to family in morecambe and lunesdale and across the country to fix this break system we need dental contract that actually work fair funding for local service and access to care that be available when people need it nhs dentistry be in crisis and south devon be no exception accord to the nuffield trust it be now at its most perilous point in its year history parent be pull out their child tooth at home pensioner be travel abroad for basic dental treatment hundred of people in the dental desert of south devon have simply give up hope of ever see an nhs dentist again last year million adult across the country could not get an nhs dental appointment more than one in four in my constituency the situation be even bad over of adult and of child in devon have not see dentist in the past two year no local practice be accept new nhs patient and waiting time can stretch into year the crisis be drive by an underfunded and outdated system that be push professional out in england nhs dentistry receive just head in scotland be tell that it be nearly double that each year hundred of million of pound in dental funding go unspent not because it be not need but because dental practice can not recruit or retain staff under the current contract the rigid contract system be also prevent dentist come up with innovative idea such as proposal for no frill low cost dental service in dartmouth in my constituency that get nowhere because of nhs red tape ask the minister when will we hear about reform dental contract the dental defence union have highlight other issue that be contribute to the collapse one major concern be fall morale among dental professional in survey of nearly dental staff report experience increase workplace pressure over the past two to three year clear signal that the work condition be drive people out of the profession dentist be also lose money to provide nhs care for every denture they fit they be out of pocket by more than no wonder over of nhs dentist say they plan to leave we need urgent action that be why the liberal democrats be call for real reform we be campaign to end dental desert and to guarantee access to an nhs dentist for everyone who need urgent or emergency care our dental rescue package would bring dentist back to the nhs by fix the broken contract and use flexible commissioning to meet local need we want an emergency scheme to ensure free nhs check up for those who be already eligible such as child new mother pregnant woman and people on low income we be also call for guarantee access to dental care for anyone need treatment before chemotherapy the long this go on the bad it get south devon need proper dental care not more delay yes preventive dental care cost money but prevention be always well and cheap than cure thank my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure this important debate also thank the dentist hygienist dental nurse and practice staff in my constituency who do so much to look after my constituent the reality be that the dentistry system we inherit from the previous government be break and we need to fix it time and again when be knock on door in gloucester hear that patient can not get the dentist appointment they need that we have people pull their own tooth out at home and that there be child with tooth rot in their mouth we need more nhs dentist in gloucester this week have launch campaign to get new dental practice in gloucester city to deliver for my constituent and write to my local icb early this week about it we need to see this new practice as soon as possible so would welcome meeting with the relevant minister to discuss my campaign to deliver new dental practice for my constituent recognise that my icb and this government have make fantastic progress on urgent dental care in gloucestershire we have another urgent dental appointment in my constituency and the wide area which be already deliver for my constituent who be most in need but what we really need be regular check up appointment so that people can be see more regularly welcome reform of the dental contract and the consultation with local dentist and encourage all dentist and dental practice in my constituency to get involve with it so that we can deliver well dentistry system than the one leave behind year ago by the conservative party thank the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for bring forward this important debate in my constituency and across scotland family be desperately struggle to access nhs dental treatment public health scotland figure show that while of child be register with an nhs dentist only about have actually be see by one in the past two year and in our most deprived area that drop to only one in two child this be despite the snp claim that of child be register with an nhs dentist when routine care disappear the consequence be see in hospital before the pandemic scotland be admit about child year for dental extraction under general anaesthetic make it the single big cause of plan childhood admission to hospital despite the clear and dire consequence of fail to address dental health and health inequality in general the government in both holyrood and westminster appear to be look the other way recent british dental association survey highlight the financial strain face by dentist with of practice say that they be struggle to stay financially viable and over half say that the recent budget have accelerate their move into the private sector with that in mind we must ask why this government choose to follow through on their national insurance rise for primary care provider such as dentist it appear that while labour manifesto say that they would support local health provider the reality for those provide care be quite different therefore join my liberal democrat colleague in call on the government to reconsider their stance on national insurance fail to return national insurance contribution to their former level will inevitably result in few nhs dental appointment few nhs dental provider and more child on operating table be there well metaphor for the state of this country than the state of dentistry fourteen year of neglect leave we with decayed system of nhs provision with those able to pay the only one protect see it myself with ward full of child with dental abscess at the weekend resident have tell story of search for nhs dental provision that simply do not exist in my constituency the number of urgent appointment have increase by with practice provide urgent dental care service seven day week and into the evening and there be more come soon so the government be make serious attempt to deal with the decade of decay and drift but we must go far we do not have enough dentist and we do not have enough dental service provider so let we sort out the dental contract which we have hear about the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison who be no long in his place be quite right that nhs dentist be in fact hero the point have be make repeatedly that dentist can earn lot more money in private practice than in nhs dentistry and that be unlikely to change no matter what happen in the renegotiation do the hon member agree with the last government review which suggest that the roughly cost of train dentist should come with requirement to work for the nhs for number of year afterwards that be certainly suggestion that should be investigate we must increase the number of dentist as we have only dentist for every people in the east of england we also need to increase the number of training provider and training place but even with the opening of dental school it will take age for there to be new dentist one suggestion be that we sort out the dental accreditation system hon member may not know that there be only opportunity to take the accreditation exam each year but there be people plan to take the exam that will take year we must get the general dental council to increase the number of exam opportunity we have begin to address this political emergency but we must go far with clear and fair offer focus on what the minister describe as the triangle of patient practitioner and the public purse provide service that ensure that we give excellent affordable care for all include prevention especially for the most vulnerable and in way that mean we can pay for it nhs dentistry can be save let we have sign on the door say urgent nhs dental appointment available here would that not that be great call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for secure this really important debate before be elect drive around winchester the meon valley and the beautiful new forest treat horse as veterinary surgeon and key part of that role be provide regular dental treatment horse do not like go to the dentist any more than human do but they need to have their tooth brush every six month at least every year or they get ulcer in their mouth and they can get infect tooth root when we have to remove tooth with root that be three inch long especially on hot day like today we work up sweat and it take long time but it be really painful for the horse even though we use painkiller and nerve block often all of that would have be avoidable have they have regular dental treatment and it cost the owner lot more money it be exactly the same with human medicine there be cross party agreement with no one dispute that prevention be well than cure and when it come to dental care in the nhs we be fail at even the most basic level of public health be not go to go through all the stat that hon member have repeat about the number of child need general anaesthetic for dental care will the hon gentleman welcome the government partnership with colgate on brushing in school so that we can tackle prevention with child and make sure they be not go into hospital with tooth decay because they be learn how to brush their tooth and do so properly absolutely welcome that fantastic initiative visit two dental practice in winchester and both tell exactly the same thing they want to do more nhs work and they want to be there for their community but because of the current nhs dental contract they simply can not make it financially viable they be effectively subsidise their nhs patient with income from private work the british dental association estimate that private dentistry in england cross subsidise nhs care to the tune of million year which be due to rise to million if nhs practice be not offer any help with the ten of thousand in additional staff cost bring in by the increase in national insurance with the nhs work they do perform they do not have time for the education the proactive holistic healthcare that they want to do instead they have to get people through in quick turnaround say this clearly dentist be not the problem they be do their good within contract that be outdated and damaging also want to speak to something that be often overlook in this conversation oral health be not just about tooth know that my dentist colleague as in veterinary practice routinely identify serious condition such as oral cancer and squamous cell carcinoma during routine dental check those cancer be often aggressive but spot early they can be treat we also know that infection in the mouth can lead to thing such as endocarditis which be not trivial condition and there be good evidence that periodontitis can contribute to the onset of dementia how many cancer be we miss how many heart problem be we not avoid by not have routine dental check will sum up now as know that we be push for time the liberal democrats will continue to fight tooth and nail for an nhs that include dentistry manage to avoid make any joke about equine dentistry and member will be glad to hear that straight from the horse mouth we do not want nhs dentistry to be an afterthought it have to be core part of truly universal holistic health service everyone deserve access to routine dental care many member have say that they live in area that be dental desert where nhs dentist be rare than hen tooth it be clear that we have cross party consensus let we get the dental contract reform and let we make this parliament the last one during which anyone have to extract their own tooth call the shadow minister congratulate the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn on secure this debate dentistry be important dentist do not just deal with our tooth they deal with our mouth and gum they identify physical disease that include cancer and they prevent sepsis last month visit the dental design studio in sleaford to celebrate its anniversary of great dentistry and meet some fabulous committed professional somewhat unexpectedly give the venue be ask to help judge cake competition member and my dentist will be pleased to know that brush my tooth very well afterwards access to nhs dentistry have be problem for very long time when move house in there be no nhs dentist available and travel two hour to redcar to see the wonderful dentist mr dixon for many year until he retire after that there be no dentist at all be we therefore short of dentist no we be not the conservative government increase the number of new trainee place and the number of new dentist and although the population increase there be still more per capita than in as the minister for care have say the issue be not the number of dentist but the paucity of dentist who be do nhs work official report march vol encourage the minister for secondary care to consider more dental place because we see that one in of the youngster who want to become dentist be turn away and as such they go overseas to train or train to do something else will she commit to dental school not just in norwich but in other underserved area such as lincoln the main problem as many have identify be the contract with the uda band for procedure and there be several issue with that first the amount vary between practice base on historical volume datum secondly there be disincentive to treat new or high need patient and thirdly the uda simply do not cover all the cost the conservatives improve that little bit iron out some of the bizarre uda contract term and set new high floor for minimum uda yet there be much more to do as we have hear today to reform it completely how be the government get on with that will the minister give we an update please as the public accounts committee note nhse and dhsc do not yet know what that reform might look like or to what timescale it can be deliver beyond vague assertion that some reform be imminent will the hon lady give way on that point will not because there be not much time at all meet eddie crouch from the bda recently who talk about the national insurance cost before today announce pay rise dental practice be face increase in staff cost again push more of they far to private practice will the minister ask the chancellor to exempt nhs dentist from the national insurance contribution rise there have also be discussion about compelling dentist to do proportion of their work in the nhs either by compelling dentist who be newly train or by incentivise with the use of student loan repayment have the government consider that we have many overseas train dentist some be british student who be train overseas some be foreign national but the overseas registration exam have people on its waiting list somewhat bizarrely those who pass can work in the private sector but not in the nhs without supervision that seem somewhat incoherent do the government have confidence in the exam or not it be illogical to allow person to practise as private dentist but not in the nhs it be also clear disincentive to nhs practice what good discussion have the government have with the general dental council about this issue my right hon friend the member for herne bay and sandwich sir roger gale have repeatedly raise the issue of ukrainian dentist there be ukrainians dentist in the uk why not assess they and allow they to work it be well for they and for we dentist form part of wide team of hygienist nurse technician and therapist what be the government do to help people in each of those role practise at the top of their skill range to provide great dental care what be the government do to support rural area since they cancel the mobile dental van what be they do to ensure they deliver the promise appointment year since they have deliver hardly any of they so far will the hon member give way will not give way because there be very little time it have be clear today that the nhs be not fit for purpose when it come to dentistry the government need to get grip of this and soon thank the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson could not have ask for well set up pay great tribute to my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn this be an issue she have pursue for some time and be grateful for her secure this important debate know many more member would have like to speak will not take any intervention in the short time have to respond because want to address some of the question raise this issue continue to be matter of great concern to members and all our constituent poor oral health can have devastating effect on individual as we have hear impact their mental and physical health alike and indeed their opportunity for work as my hon friend the member for leigh and atherton jo platt make clear yet it be largely preventable issue through good oral health hygiene and regular visit to dentist we inherit broken nhs dental system and our ambition be to rescue and restore nhs dentistry so that we deliver more nhs dental care to those who need it fourteen year of neglect cut and incompetence by the previous government have leave nhs dentistry in state of decay that be simply unacceptable and need to change which it will as of march more than dentist be register with the general dental council in england and yet less than full time equivalent dentist be work within the nhs lord darzi say in his report there be enough dentist in england just not enough dentist willing to do enough nhs work that be why this government be prepared to take strong action since come into office we have make good progress on our plan for change we have already take action to address the immediate need of patient in pain and require urgent dental care through our manifesto commitment to deliver an additional urgent dental appointment per year integrated care board start to deliver those appointment from april and each area have be give expectation for delivery base on their local need that point be note by my hon friend the members for filton and bradley stoke claire hazelgrove and for amber valley linsey farnsworth who campaign studiously in opposition and continue to bring this to the house icb have return detailed plan for deliver against the expectation and the minister for care be hold regular meeting with official in the department and with nhs england to monitor and drive progress against those plan commend my hon friend the member for gloucester alex mcintyre for pursue the matter with his icb that be exactly the right thing to do to have truly effective dental system we can not focus just on those already in pain we must have system that prioritise prevention particularly for child point well make by my hon friend the members for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell for blackpool south chris webb and for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge that be why we have invest over million to roll out national supervised toothbrushing programme for three to five year old that will reach up to child year in the most deprived area of england alongside that we have launch an innovative partnership with colgate palmolive which be donate more than million toothbrush and toothpaste over the next five year that be incredible value for the taxpayer and fantastic example of how business and government can work together for public good we have also take the decision to expand community water fluoridation across the north east of england that be the first expansion for decade and will bring benefit to an additional million people in the region our workforce be crucial as we have hear this afternoon strong dentistry system need strong workforce and we recognise the incredible work that dentist and dental professional do pay tribute to mr dobranski mention by my hon friend the member for leigh and atherton what amazing service also mention my own dentist aidan moran who have be see for the good part of three decade central part of our year health plan will be our workforce and how to make sure that we train and provide the staff technology and infrastructure the nhs need to care for patient across our community point well make by my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley we will publish refreshed workforce plan to make sure the nhs have the right people in the right place with the right skill to deliver the care that people need as my hon friend the member for south norfolk ben goldsborough highlight we be all sadly familiar with the term dental desert to describe part of the country where access be especially difficult we be continue to support integrate care board through the golden hello scheme but of course dentist be only part of the team dental therapist hygienist nurse and technician all play vital role and we need to make the nhs well place to work for all of they we be commit to fundamental reform of the dental contract it could have be do soon it could have be do at any point over the last year by the coalition or the tories but they leave it for we to do it will take time but assure everyone here that development of these proposal be under way we continue to work with the british dental association and other representative to deliver our share ambition for dentistry my hon friend the minister for care meet the bda recently and they have productive relationship in the spirit of honesty let be clear there be no perfect payment model and any change to the complex dental system must be carefully consider so that we deliver genuine improvement for patient and the profession it be an immense challenge there be no quick fix and no easy answer but people across the country deserve well access and we be determined to make that happen we know we must deal with the immediate crisis that be why we will deliver extra appointment each year get more dentist into the community that need they the most and make sure that everyone who need an nhs dentist can get one nhs dentistry will not be rescue overnight it will take time investment and reform but improve access to nhs dentistry be key to our mission to get the nhs back on its foot and fit for the future be grateful for the number of members who participate in the debate and can only apologise to those who be not able to get in or whose time to speak be shorten thank the minister for her comprehensive response it be clear that we have some way to go before we get the sort of service that people across the country in all our constituency deserve but be confident that she will take this forward have hear all the comment and suggestion make this afternoon question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider access to nhs dentistry diego garcia military base with permission mr speaker wish to make statement on the diego garcia military base for more than year the joint uk us military base on diego garcia have be launchpad to defeat terrorist to prevent threat to our nation and to protect our economic security this base keep britain secure at home and strong abroad this afternoon the prime minister have sign treaty with prime minister ramgoolam of mauritius that guarantee full continued uk control of diego garcia for the next year and beyond pay tribute to the uk negotiator to the team from the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence who support they and to the mauritian official who work for two and half year to reach this agreement my right hon friend the foreign secretary have today lay in the house the full treaty text and his formal exchange of letter with the foreign minister of mauritius that confirm the agreement and the financial arrangement between our two country bill will be introduce soon there have be great deal of misinformation about this treaty much of it fuel by the conservative party but the simple truth be that our national security rest on secure deal that protect the operational sovereignty of this vital military installation by sign this treaty on our term the prime minister have ensure that the uk retain full control of diego garcia throughout the next century and beyond it be deal strike in the national interest and deal that make britons today and generation to come safe and more secure the importance of diego garcia can not be overstate some of the operation on our joint uk us base be in the public domain most by necessity be not but all the work conduct from diego garcia play crucial role in protect our nation our armed force and our trade route diego garcia be unique we do thing there that we simply could not do anywhere else its airfield allow for strike operation and rapid deployment to the middle east east africa and south asia its deep water port support mission from nuclear power submarine to our carrier strike group it host surveillance station that disrupt terrorist attack protect satellite and provide global intelligence capability and it project uk us military power in the indo pacific to reinforce regional stability and security america be our close security ally and continue use of this base be fundamental to maintain the special strength of that relationship in fact diego garcia be our nation most significant contribution to the uk us security partnership that have keep we safe for nearly year as have say this be joint military base and almost every operation conduct from it be do in partnership with the us that be why the treaty have the full throate support of the us secretary of state marco rubio who have say this afternoon this agreement secure the long term stable and effective operation of the joint military facility at diego garcia which be critical to regional and global security president trump himself have describe this as very long term and very strong diego garcia also strengthen britain economic security over one third of the world bulk cargo traffic and two third of global oil shipment be transport through the indian ocean our constant presence in these water serve to safeguard trade route keep down the price of food and energy for britons here at home diego garcia be also the permanent location of critical comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty monitoring equipment network that watch every moment of every day for evidence of nuclear testing to hold nuclear and would be nuclear power to account diego garcia be one of just four location in the world to operate ground station antennae for the global positioning system which everyone from astronaut to motorist and our military rely on to navigate quite simply the loss of the diego garcia military base would be unthinkable and yet without action without this deal within week we could face lose legal ruling and within just few year the base would become inoperable some have suggest simply ignore international legal decision but this be not just about international law this be about the direct impact of law on our ability to control and operate this base ruling against we would mean we could not prevent hostile nation from set up installation around diego garcia on the outer island or carry out joint exercise near the base no deal would mean we could not guarantee the safe berth of our sub patrol the water around the base control the airspace directly above or protect the integrity of our communication system such development would deeply damage the security interest of the uk and our ally it would be dereliction of the first duty of government agree this treaty now on our term mean that the uk retain full control over diego garcia now and for the next century we have lay before the house the full treaty and the associate costing those on the conservative front bench will see how we have toughen the term of the deal they be do so it do now guarantee the uk national interest and national security at cost of less than of the annual defence budget we have secure unrestricted access to and use of the base as well as control over movement of all person and all good on the base and control of all communication and electronic system nothing can be build within nautical mile buffer zone without our say so and we have secure an effective veto on all development in the chagos archipelago and strict ban will be impose on foreign security force operate on the outer island all provision that be not in the draft agreement that have be negotiate by the conservative party before the election just say to the party opposite that anyone who would abandon this deal would abandon the base they would weaken the security of the british people and weaken the strength of the british armed force by sign this deal the british flag will fly over the diego garcia base well into the next century by sign this deal the relationship with our close security ally will be strengthen by sign this deal our capacity to deter our adversary and defend uk interest be secure for generation to come as the world become more dangerous diego garcia become more important this government will never compromise on our national security with this deal we have make britain more secure at home and strong abroad call the shadow secretary of state pm be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement before go into the detail however wish to place two important point on the record first it be beneath contempt for the prime minister in his press conference to state that those who oppose this deal be on the side of russia and china be intensely proud of the role that my party have play in support ukraine have wear this badge of the ukrainian flag every day and many of my colleague have be sanction by russia and china and passionately believe that we must stand up to they indeed that be one of the reason we oppose this deal let we not forget that only last week mauritius agree to deepen maritime co operation with russia and this week china say that it want to deepen its strategic partnership with mauritius and that that country be well place with strategic advantage this be democracy if we as elect parliamentarian choose to take different view on this issue and vote against the deal that do not make we pro russian or pro chinese vote against this deal do not make we traitor to this country it make we patriot secondly the secretary of state and his defence ministers have say time on the floor of the house that the urgently need strategic defence review would be deliver by the spring but he have break that promise here we be at literally at the last sit moment of this spring and instead of the sdr he have come to the house to announce total abject surrender of our territory and fundamental betrayal of the uk national interest the government be not surrender british sovereign territory because of military defeat or because of bind legal verdict but wilfully due to total failure to take stand and fight for britain interest on the world stage complete and utter negotiating failure yes it be true that we hold talk with the mauritians when in government but we never sign deal why because we fundamentally oppose the idea of spend billion of pound on surrender tax to lease back land that we currently own freehold and it be billion of pound will the secretary of state confirm that the deal will cost billion over the next five year when the prime minister recently give statement to the house about defence spending he use the cash figure to state by how much spending would rise will the secretary of state confirm that on the same basis this deal will cost uk taxpayer over billion will he confirm definitively how much of that cost will come from the ministry of defence budget mr speaker you will be interested to hear that on military operation the treaty confirm that we must expeditiously inform mauritius of any armed attack on third state directly emanate from the base on diego garcia will the secretary of state confirm that that mean we would need to tell mauritius if the base be to be use to launch strike against iran or its proxy what guarantee have he receive that mauritius would not tell potential adversary as we all know the key issue be that the government fear bind legal judgment interruption they be follow the legal advice to act definitively to our detriment entirely on the basis of hypothetical risk that have not yet materialise and that we could challenge and that be part of pattern on monday with the eu defence pact the secretary of state admit that he have secure only potential participation in the rearmament fund but despite no guarantee of hard cash for defence the government have already give up our sovereign fishing ground for over decade yesterday the secretary of state for northern ireland refuse to explain why this government fail to appeal the legal decision that now threaten our veteran with new era of lawfare for the crime of serve this nation and keep we safe all those year ago and today with chagos once again the government have prioritise heed the most pessimistic legal advice even though we have expose the fact that fear of bind threat from the international telecommunication union or the united nations convention on the law of the sea be overblown as the hon member for crawley peter lamb labour back bencher say early we be all get real tired of this the court have settle it line of argument it be not so much case of no surrender as yes surrender every single time always listen to the lawyer instead of our national interest even if that mean surrender our veteran our fishing ground and the chagos may suggest they change the lyric of their labour party song because we all know that they will keep the white flag fly here order do not want to interrupt but mr gemmell you be not be helpful to your cause it be the bad day to be throw out so please want to hear no more from you it have be continuous perhaps the hon gentleman be expect to hear the strategic defence review as all of we be give the government multiple promise finally the chagossian community have be shamefully sideline by this government from start to finish with only tick box engagement by junior ministers be it not the case that the treaty offer no protection to the chagossians whatsoever when labour negotiate britain lose the government should not be surrender strategically vital sovereign territory especially when we face such threat and they certainly should not be pay billion for the privilege we would abandon this deal but we would never abandon the chagos island this be bad deal for britain and we will do everything possible to oppose it regret the tone that the hon gentleman have strike this the prime minister be make simple point if the base go the country that benefit the country that want to see the base go and the deal fail be china russia and iran quite simply he be ask whose side of the argument be we on yes whose side be you on interruption frankly if you do not back the deal you do not back the base shameful order will decide what be and be not shameful be go to say this once and for all mr cartlidge you have be push and push for quite while emotion be run high but do not want continuous barracking and that level of noise come from you you should be set good example as the shadow secretary of state keep calm and be effective not bawl quite simply if you do not back the deal you can not back the base there be no viable alternative option than this deal the senior military figure who be part of the treaty signing this afternoon general sir jim hockenhull confirm that publicly the shadow defence secretary know that he be defence minister until the last election he know that that be the advice he and the previous government be give even the spokesperson for his party leader admit in february that deal be need politico playbook report spokesperson for badenoch insist she understand negotiation over the island be need due to the international legal position that be the job that we have do the conservatives concede the principle that negotiation be necessary and deal be require to safeguard the long term protection and control of this base they conduct round of negotiation before the last election the hon gentleman talk about this be part of pattern the previous government fail to deliver trade deal with india and we do it they fail to deliver trade deal with the us and we do it they fail to safeguard diego garcia and we have do it we pick up those negotiation and strengthen the defence protection for the uk and we do the deal today the hon gentleman ask about the money once again he be not just defence minister but also treasury minister before the last election in fact he be exchequer secretary when the negotiation first kick off he know that the government actuary tell we that the full accounting cost of this deal over the year be billion that be the figure report and lay before the house today the hon gentleman will know that there be long establish method use under our government his government and the previous government for account for long term project like this base the nuclear commission programme big infrastructure project and pension liability the fact for as defence secretary be that the cost of this deal be less than of the annual defence budget that this be an essential deal for our national security that will ensure britain be well equip to face down the rise threat we face and that our armed force be strong and safe because of the deal do today the hon gentleman ask about the chagossians we have be concern since we be elect just month ago to restore good communication and well relation with wide range of chagossian group the foreign office minister my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty have meet they regularly and he and my right hon friend the foreign secretary meet they this morning the negotiation however be between the mauritian government and the uk government just as they be under the previous government we have work to ensure that the agreement reflect the importance that chagossians attach to the island so we will finance new million trust fund for mauritius to support the chagossian community will conclude where start say to the shadow defence secretary we have work together on cross party basis on ukraine and we have offer he and his party leader security briefing on any of the big issue that we face this deal be in the national security interest that be why when we be in opposition we back his government when they set out to try to negotiate that deal just as we back his government when he lead the uk support for ukraine when he look at the treaty consider that there be no alternative and recognise that this be tough deal that be well for our base well for our force and well for protect our british people in this country hope that he will back it in the and labour and conservative governments remove the chagossian people from their island in the interest of national security in response to write question the foreign office have confirm that many certainty that would be require for chagossian to return to the island have not be secure as part of this deal once more ban they in the name of national security what should tell my chagossian constituent when they ask about the moral basis on which the uk be once again ignore their right to self determination while we fight for it in ukraine for ukrainians on what basis can member of british overseas territory feel any certainty that they will retain possession of their island in the event that our national security interest be suddenly pique have know my hon friend for long time and he have be loud and strong voice for chagossians in this country hope he will recognise first that this have be negotiation that the british government have conduct with the mauritian government hope he will also recognise and respect the fact that my right hon friend the foreign secretary and the minister my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth have try to set new tone in relationship and communication with the range of chagossian group in this country finally hope he will recognise that that range of chagossian group include range of chagossian view some of which support this deal and see the need for it trust he will be strong in advocate for the use of the trust fund and the programme we will put in place to help the chagossian people call the liberal democrat spokesperson liberal democrats support the uk comply with international law but the process for agree this deal have be more than little bit bumpy while the conservatives have feign anger border on hysteria at time despite it be their foreign secretary who first signal the uk intention to secure an agreement this government have fail consistently to provide any clarity on the progress of the deal we do not need running commentary but we do need to know that public money be be use wisely it be also clear that the government be prepared to give donald trump the ultimate veto over any agreement without regard for the priority of chagossians themselves as the deal have now be reach can the secretary of state confirm what issue chagossian raise during their meeting with ministers and how the government have respond to ensure their voice and issue have be address in this deal in attempt yesterday to humiliate south africa president cyril ramaphosa president trump prove once again his instinct as unreliable and an unpredictable bully have now confirm this deal on share uk us asset how confident be the secretary of state that diego garcia will not be use by this white house to advance foreign policy objective that we deem contrary to our principle and interest hard work family around the country will rightly be question why the government be reportedly willing to negotiate such significant sum pay to mauritius at time when the personal independence payment be be severely scale back will the secretary of state put on record today the propose schedule of payment as they relate to the deal and when it be expect that that schedule will commence as the government have previously confirm the treaty must come before the house for scrutiny especially give its importance to our national security and its implication for the exchequer hope this set valuable precedent that could be apply to future trade deal for instance so can the secretary of state confirm when this house will have an opportunity to scrutinise the propose deal as well as chance to vote on its ratification the answer to the hon gentleman question be that from this point this house have the full opportunity to scrutinise the deal that be why my right hon friend the foreign secretary have place the full text of the treaty before this house together with the financial arrangement the hon gentleman say that the negotiator have not be give run commentary but he also say that he do not want run commentary because he respect the fact that in any negotiation there have to be private space in which discussion can take place have say consistently that when the treaty be ready and put before the house the full financial information will come alongside it that have happen today the proper scrutiny by this house begin today and when the bill be publish soon the hon gentleman will be able to scrutinise that too on the question of the chagossians we will provide million so that the mauritians can set up new trust fund for those community let turn to the hon gentleman question about the us this treaty have be negotiate between and sign today by our prime minister and the mauritian prime minister it secure vital defence and intelligence base for britain but as say in my statement almost everything we do on this base be do jointly with the us so of course we have keep the americans inform and consult they at no point have the us have veto this be our deal and our decision bring it to the house this afternoon because it be in our good national interest and our good security interest rise order mr mayhew do you have comment to make indicate dissent shake your head and make comment that be certainly not the example want to see when be look to keep the house calm do not need the backchat that have be go on for while the conservatives start negotiation on handing over the chagos island because they understand the national security implication of not do deal indeed they do round of negotiation on this deal now with our close security partner the americans the canadians the australians and the new zealanders all welcome this deal why be the conservatives play politic with our national security entirely agree with my hon friend he make powerful point in judicious way the shadow defence secretary could learn bit from he both the prime minister in his extensive press conference prior to the secretary of state for defence come to the house and the secretary of state have say on numerous occasion that this deal be the only way of protect the military operation on diego garcia when be foreign secretary do not see anything to make agree that this be the only way of protect military operation on that base the defence secretary suggest in his statement that judgment could come within week that would undermine the operation of the base from which bind legal authority do he fear that jurisdiction may come we know it be not the international telecommunication union or the international court of justice who do he believe would prevent we from military operation on that island the right hon gentleman be formidable and very senior figure in the previous government he be in the post of foreign secretary during the period when there be negotiation on this deal by enter into the negotiation his government accept and concede the principle that negotiate deal be the way to secure the full operational sovereignty of this base for the long term the right hon gentleman may well not have be satisfied with the deal that his own people could have negotiate at the time because when we pick up the negotiation there be no agreement on an effective uk veto across the archipelago which we have now there be no buffer zone accept in that agreement which there be now there be no agreement in that text for year or the option of an extra year which we have get in there now and there be also not an agreement for mauritius to take on responsibility for any migrant but there be now hope that the right hon gentleman look at the new text of the treaty and hope he will back it when it come before the house rise to welcome this agreement which safeguard vital national security asset and cement the united kingdom role at the heart of global defence co operation let we be clear this treaty be about protect britain ability to defend itself and its ally diego garcia be not just piece of land in the indian ocean but the backbone of our joint operation with the united states and linchpin of the uk ability to project power to deter threat and to ensure security in an increasingly unstable world all our close ally the us australia new zealand canada and india support this deal nato support this deal they understand what diego garcia represent unmatched strategic certainty will the secretary of state please give we more information about how we will be protect the area around the island my hon friend be absolutely right our close ally take close interest and they can see that this treaty be the good way of securing for the uk for the us and for themselves vital base on which we can help both to project military power and to reinforce regional security my hon friend will see the nautical mile buffer zone an exclusion zone if you like that allow we to control the sea and the air we would not be able to do that increasingly without the deal she will see that sweep and an effective veto on any development across the archipelago to range of at least nautical mile she will also see the value of deal that guarantee our full operational sovereignty and therefore prevent any undermining of our ability to use the electromagnetic spectrum as say in my statement that be so crucial to the unique capability that this base and its operation offer to this country and to the united states when former foreign secretary ask sit defence secretary for direct answer as to which court would be able to make bind judgment against we on this matter he be entitle to direct answer so will the secretary of state now give that direct answer there be range of international legal challenge and ruling against we the most proximate and the most potentially serious be the international tribunal for the law of the sea my right hon friend have set out that this deal which be essential for our national security will cost less than quarter of of our national defence budget will he also confirm that this deal cost far less than other base deal such as france deal with djibouti yet offer vastly superior strategic scale and value can indeed and my right hon friend be right this deal will cost less than of the defence budget it compare very favourably with the million that the french pay for their djibouti base which by the way be right next to chinese base diego garcia be time big than the french base in djibouti and have an exclusion zone around it which help to protect our operation and the intelligence service that we have there my right hon friend be right this be good investment for the future national security of this country this morning be at the high court to listen to the judgment be with very large group of chagossians who tell that they feel betrayed they also feel that the united kingdom be act in exactly the same high handed colonial like manner that lead to their dislocation and displacement from the island in the can those on the government front bench assure we all that when this deal come back to the house we be not go to be ask to vote for new round of colonial practice that will far disadvantage the chagossians of course we be not go to ask that we deeply regret the way that the chagossians be remove from the island we have express that sentiment as new government since july we have make provision in the treaty to support the chagossian community but the hon gentleman will recognise that there be wide range of view within the chagossian community and group some of they see the value of this deal and some of they support it the important fact for we be that the legal challenge in the high court demonstrate some of the legal difficulty that would continue to bedevil the operation of this base without the deal that our prime minister have sign today commend my right hon friend for explain in as much detail as he be able on the floor of the house why he believe that this be necessary act and trust he to have the security of the nation as his top priority however element of the treaty can not be talk about even at the point when this house may vote on it there be only one member of this house who have access to all area of government spending the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown do my right hon friend agree that some area need deep scrutiny and will he support our plan to have scrutiny committee that can examine sensitive issue include this one my hon friend know that have have discussion with she and the hon member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown about the capability of the house of commons to scrutinise and hold to account the government of whatever party in area of necessarily highly secret and confidential activity she know that have different view about how to deal with that challenge but deal with it we must the secretary of state have cite unclos under pressure from my right hon friend the members for braintree sir james cleverly and for new forest east sir julian the reason for this expensive cave in be familiar with unclos and although be layman and so be the secretary of state could he explain in lay term which part of unclos be responsible for what have happen because it be not clear to and it will not be clear to my constituent and to his who will be pay the bill for this the judgment of any international tribunal or court do not necessarily just apply to the uk they be take by other agency other organisation and other nation in particular as my right hon and learn friend the prime minister spell out this afternoon if there be uncertainty or bind finding against the uk about the sovereignty of diego garcia our ability to protect in particular and most immediately the electromagnetic spectrum on which our sensor radar communication and intelligence function depend be compromise that be the security assessment and that be the military view that be why we have take this step and recognise that the good and only way of safeguard the operational sovereignty the total control and protection of the diego garcia island base for the future be the deal we have strike this afternoon be alarm by the passion of conservative members for the chagos island because we care about they will the hon member let finish have on number of occasion intervene on conservative members to ask they to name the chagos island and they have be unable to tell that there be diego garcia peros banhos the salomon island the egmont island well you have to write they down do not share the right hon member passion similarly the leader of the opposition first tweet about the chagos island in october that be five year after the icj ruling and two year after negotiation start do my right hon friend agree that the conservatives new find passion for the chagos island perhaps owe more to political opportunism than to any deeply hold conviction do indeed and have to say that be relieve my hon friend have not ask to name all plus island in the archipelago the mauritians have never ever own the chagos island when they gain independence from the united kingdom in the the uk pay they million of pound to cede any future claim over the sovereignty of the chagos island the defence secretary have confirm the strategic importance of the chagos island and we all agree on that but the truth be that this be the bad ever deal in history by this country over year we be pay with inflation over billion to give away strategically important security asset the truth be and confirm it now that when reform win the next general election we will rip up this deal tear it up and stop all future payment it be disgrace that be total rubbish not just the hon member figure but his assertion our close ally which have take the close look at the deal we have negotiate see this as the way we can secure the joint operation and the control of this base through this deal we can jointly guarantee that for the next century and beyond we have go over the cost and it be less than of the defence budget for this we get the security of be able to continue operate an intelligence and defence base do activity and operation that we simply could not do anywhere else this be good investment for britain and britain be safe today because of the deal we have strike the conservative party have terrible record on defence with abject failure after abject failure think we have see this afternoon that conservative members have not learn from those lesson do the secretary of state agree that in back this deal with support from the us nato five eye and some of our big ally in the indo pacific region such as india and australia the labour party be show that it care seriously about national security will put the national interest first and unlike the party opposite will not make meaningless gesture to put our own party first do indeed this be base that have save british life for over year it have save the life of people at home in this country because it have be the launchpad from which we have defeat terrorist attack it have also be the launchpad for protect and save the life of british force when they have be deploy to war zone around the world this deal which we sign today mean we can continue to exercise the full control necessary to continue to do that for the century to come may in all candour suggest to the government that have now introduce this new element the un convention on the law of the sea and presume the associate international tribunal for the law of the sea as the decisive factor that might have create bind ruling it really be incumbent on the government to set out in statement exactly how it would have affect the electromagnetic spectrum or our ability to use it in the foreign secretary might just calm down for minute just want proper explanation make this forecast to cut personal independence payment and winter fuel allowance to pay billion of pound for something that be already british sovereign territory how be the secretary of state go to explain that on the doorstep to all his party voter promise you we will make sure that they never hear the end of it the hon gentleman might just like to remember this and make the comparison the total cost over the year of the deal we have strike to protect this space and british control over it be less than the value of the personal protective equipment that be unusable and that be burn because the last government buy it in the first year of the covid pandemic the us support this deal nato support this deal india support this deal do the secretary of state share my surprise that opposition members seem so intent on ignore our ally my hon friend make powerful point very succinctly hope this house have hear it and hope the conservative party listen to it the right hon gentleman know the regard have for he and for the foreign secretary he know too of my interest and involvement in national security matter there be no debate across the house about the salience of diego garcia it be absolutely critical to our national interest the debate be about the legal advice will he in the interest of scrutiny provide where it do not compromise national security all the information and advice give to he and previous ministers on the subject of that legal advice we suspect that that advice could have be challenge and suspect that many previous holder of his office and other will have receive similar if not the same legal advice and resist it this house will have plenty of opportunity to test and debate these issue but the right hon gentleman might start by ask those of his right hon friend who be in government at the time they start negotiation and judge at the time that negotiation on the deal be necessary to safeguard the future of diego garcia and the full operational control of the base commend the secretary of state for his calm and measured approach to this really serious topic will he expand on the safeguard in the deal in particular the mile nautical exclusion or buffer zone and the ban on foreign military presence which guarantee full uk command of the base remind opposition colleague that it be important to lead and not follow and to use sensible measured language not charge mistruth the provision of the treaty as my hon friend will see from the full text guarantee the right of the uk in the nautical mile zone immediately around the island and in the airspace above to patrol and control that airspace if we see succession of legal judgment that start to establish mauritian claim to sovereignty that would undermine and weaken our ability to conduct those patrol control the sky and protect the base under this deal we will be pay billion of pound for the privilege of have our own territory take away from we the secretary of state talk about the threat to the base as if mauritius country with no navy be about to steam in or pick fight with the united states that be implausible the whole house will have hear the secretary of state try to dodge the question from the former foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for braintree sir james cleverly and on be press scramble around for legal argument and come up with something totally novel and hazy the truth be that our constituent be go to be pay billion so that the prime minister can bask in the warm glow of approval from his fellow human right lawyer absolute rubbish it be billion over year which be less than of the annual defence budget this be good investment for unique capability that have play an essential role in defeat terrorism and break up terrorist group deploy british force protect our trade route and monitor nuclear threat around the globe this be an essential base we run it jointly with the us which be full square behind we and hope the hon gentleman party will be the same thank the secretary of state for set out very clearly why this be the right thing to do for the uk could he share with the house any threat assessment that he have indicate that without guarantee access to diego garcia and guarantee be the key word china and other country could attempt to expand their regional military presence building installation close to the base of course china want to try to move in on the chagos archipelago of course it want to try to set up operation or activity that would allow it to interfere or monitor what we do from the base this deal help to protect the base and help to prevent that from happen thank you mr speaker mean it this time the secretary of state have assert from the dispatch box that it be the risk of an unclos judgment that be require this capitulation of sovereignty can he therefore answer this specific question be he aware of single case that be live under unclos at the moment against the united kingdom within few week we expect ruling that will start to weaken our ability to control and maintain our full operational sovereignty over diego garcia within few year we expect that to be at point where it compromise our ability to continue the operation that be so essential to protect people at home as well as protect our force when they deploy around the world national security decision and debate should be lead by fact not political point scoring as we have see today do the secretary of state agree that have the conservatives perform some sort of miracle and stay in government at the election they too would have sign this deal and we would have support that in the interest of national security do not want to speak for the conservatives but clearly they be try to negotiate deal they have have round of negotiation any government elect in july would have be face with the challenge of how to secure this space for the long term it be clear that that be their direction and that they have concede that principle in government regret the fact that they be not consistent in pursue that principle recognise the way that we have strengthen the deal and do the deal that they be unable to secure be concerned about the influence of foreign nation levy through the criminal court if it be not too vague should like to read out very brief quote society grow great when old man plant tree in whose shade they shall never sit give that this land be always go to be ours and now it will be ours for only more year who will benefit from that shade in century the british people and british force will benefit from that shade they will continue to benefit from that shade beyond the year if we choose as nation at that point to exercise our first refusal to extend the deal for another year that be provision that be not in the deal that the conservatives negotiate it be provision that extend our ability to control this space for the long term for our national security thank the secretary of state for his statement as the prime minister confirm early today the cost of this deal be slightly less than the average annual cost of just one aircraft carrier without the aircraft do the secretary of state agree that this be price well worth pay to ensure our country safety and security it be definitely good investment for this country it help protect our security at home it help strengthen our force abroad it help reinforce that very special security relationship that we have with our close ally the united states hope the defence secretary be fully across the detail here annex paragraph sub paragraph state mauritius and the united kingdom shall jointly decide upon the management and use of the electromagnetic spectrum in the chagos archipelago beyond diego garcia give that diego garcia shall be represent by mauritius at the international telecommunication union as per letter on may how will control and management of the electromagnetic spectrum be reflect as per annex paragraph sub paragraph clause iv and give the threat pose by chinese influence in the indo pacific and the level of chinese development finance investment in mauritius what assessment have the government make of future lack of co operation from mauritius on access to say electromagnetic spectrum will have word with my right hon friend the chief whip and just let he know that the hon gentleman have make an early bid for membership of the bill committee do the secretary of state agree that it be tell that one of the many tory prime ministers that we have over their year in government the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak say in that he want to conclude deal soon be it not the case that the bluster and the red face that we have see from the conservative party today be nothing more than the bad type of political hypocrisy pay tribute to my hon friend who have quote that have not manage to get and will ask he to pass it on to he make very powerful point to this house and to the conservative party number of whom serve under the right hon gentleman who be prime minister at the time the government position appear to be predicate on hypothetical judgment to hypothetical claim in this hypothetical scenario why would the government not simply appeal the jeopardy and the uncertainty over this space be put at risk security operation that be essential to we and our ally we be not prepared to take that risk with national security we have do deal in order to secure for the long term the guarantee full operational continue control of diego garcia and that military base america back the deal canada back the deal australia back the deal new zealand back the deal our relationship with the five eyes country be our most crucial intelligence relationship so do the secretary of state agree that it would have be dereliction of duty to our country and those four country to have fail to do this deal well say and would add that india support the deal those country which be our staunch ally be our strong supporter on this deal the country that be our adversary that do we harm and that want to be able to move into the part of the world of this archipelago do not want we to have the base and do not want the deal so there be question whose side of the argument be you on respect the expertise of the defence secretary so hope he can help here the icj say that it be non bind decision the international tribunal for the law of the sea be the court that he be worried about the country will wonder why he would not challenge this in the court stand by it and see what that process would look like if he be worried he would lose will he publish the documentation that show why he be advise that he would lose so that the country can understand why he be not make that challenge if he fail in that challenge he could appeal as well to the public it look like we be just give into the deal without even use the court that we could legally use the chief whip have second volunteer for the committee stage of this legislation there be an accumulation of legal challenge and there be serious risk of legal ruling this be not just matter of international law it be about the direct impact on the operation of this base that be essential to our national security the risk that this pose put the future operation of the base in jeopardy and no responsible government can stand by and simply say we can not act no action be not an option and that be why we strike the deal and sign the treaty today petition location of the torbay and south devon nhs out of hour primary percutaneous coronary intervention services rise to present petition on behalf of the resident of south devon concern the propose temporary co location of the torbay and south devon nhs foundation trust out of hour primary

trans pennine project motion make and question propose that this house do now foxcroft it be pleasure and privilege to have secure the last adjournment debate before recess especially on an issue that be of great importance to my constituent cumbria and the wide region start with an apology to the minister recess be start and half our colleague have already set off to their constituency and have drag she in for the graveyard shift be sorry but it be appreciate we be rapidly approach completion of the spending review have spend month communicate with official in national highways and along with my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth with ministers in the department for transport and the treasury view this as my last chance to help get the project over the line in preparation for what be my first adjournment debate note the last time that politician with my surname speak in pre recess adjournment debate it be year ago and the then speaker perhaps set an unusual precedent join in the debate if you want to say some supportive word mr speaker be sure that my constituent would be very pleased although admit that the extent to which speaker martin stick to the topic of the debate in be debatable the northern trans pennine project be the north of england large road project and at cost of billion it should come as no surprise to anyone that the new government be review the business case will set out the importance of the project for my constituent and why it must go ahead know that the minister will not preannounce from the dispatch box the outcome of the spending review but hope that she will confirm that the project be in the running and have not be shelve as be claim by conservative politician on bbc television last week that politician oversaw and leave council on the brink of bankruptcy and the irony of they now pontificate on the nation finance be frankly bizarre take the financial position inherit from the last government very seriously and applaud the government mission of secure sustained growth the important thing for those of we in the rural north be that we see our fair share of that growth and the investment that enable it the last decade have give we reason to worry the institute for public policy research north have produce figure show that between and the north miss out on billion in transport investment compare with london lost decade that only leave we weak at time when we need growth last year the same think tank calculate that total public spending on transport project in be per person in london which be more than double the per person spend on the north therefore welcome the government renew focus on the north and the recent announcement of high investment in the north of england this year as part of labour plan for change indeed the prime minister have indicate that the government will be spend more than double the money per head on local transport in the north than in the south this year but still remember the last government integrate rail plan for the north which make not one mention of cumbria see this project as key enabler for deliver growth in my region the project will see the upgrade of approximately mile of the between the at penrith and the at scotch corner convert single carriageway section into dual carriageway and improve countless junction along the route feel obliged to offer some expectation management to my constituent as not one mile of the road will be dualle in the penrith and solway constituency the major benefit for the resident of penrith will be the upgrade to the junction of the and the kemplay roundabout can not count the number of time have sit in traffic on those junction alongside local resident fight through the commercial and tourist traffic just try to go about their daily business with tourist stick just at the beginning or end of their holiday in the lake district national park or north pennines and the heavy good vehicle driver anxiously think about their tachograph perhaps they be think about dinner and get home to their family as be sure some hon member be now some be simply travel down the possibly not even conscious that bottleneck on an adjacent road be the cause of their delay journey the plan underpass just outside penrith will separate the east west traffic from the north south flow that will reduce traffic volume by and provide major benefit for local people include pedestrian and cyclist improve access to penrith itself and the facility and business around the roundabout it will reduce delay and queue at the junction and will ensure that visitor have much well start to their holiday whether they be travel by car or take advantage of the local active travel network there will be environmental benefit and economic benefit we would feel as if the government have prioritise the rural north so often neglect by central government this project will improve connection between cumbria north yorkshire the tees valley tyne and wear and beyond it be the most direct route between the central belt of scotland and the eastern side of england it connect city such as glasgow and edinburgh with leeds sheffield and norwich if those journey be make by road safety have be huge concern along the route and there have be number of avoidable death over the last few year the junction of particular concern be in the richmond and northallerton and the westmorland and lonsdale constituency and know that the hon member represent those area have raise their concern with ministers however the wide route be regularly use by my constituent and be acutely aware of the risk that stretch of the road present adjacent to the kemplay roundabout be the cumbria fire and police headquarters with operational element at both in the summer it can take minute for non emergency vehicle to travel metre for our emergency service that congestion present significant issue and know that dave allen cumbria police fire and crime commissioner fully support the project not only to improve emergency vehicle access but to make the safe after my election in july meet national highways to discuss the scheme know that this government face difficult choice want reassurance that the business case be up to date and would withstand scrutiny the primary economic benefit come from travel time saving that will be realise by business user the be an important route for freight traffic with hgv comprise quarter of the vehicle on the route and the fact that that be more than double the national average highlight the importance of the route for business the regular closure on the exist route present significant disruption for business to business transaction with many of my constituency business directly affect during discussion with national highways it become apparent that exist treasury green book guidance prevent distinction be make in the economic case between general road user and business vehicle that mean that the cost benefit ratio do not distinguish between an individual make social trip in car and an hgv deliver vital component to factory for road project so important to business that be disaster understand that new guidance be on the way but not in time for it to be use to appraise this project in this spending review that limit the ability for the economic case to tell the true story so effort have be put in to reflect that within the strategic case however that still leave uncomfortable that the true benefit of the scheme be not fully articulated as frustrated as be the economic case as it stand still predict hundred of million of pound of benefit primarily through cost efficiency and save to business and even additional tax revenue through employment the project be vital for cumbria it will reduce road traffic accident and death on the single carriage section of the route it will improve strategic regional and national connectivity particularly for haulier heavy good vehicle which account for quarter of all traffic on the road be double the national average it will reduce delay and queue during busy period and improve the performance of key junction such as the junction and junction it might even occasionally stop miss the train appeal to ministers to support this project let we come to minister greenwood even though have be tempt to say that hope it be not another year before we discuss this again with campbell savours begin by congratulate my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours on secure today debate on the northern trans pennine project and thank he for his powerful argument it have be some time since travel on the which tell that it be time for trip to the lake district sometime soon although will be rather wary now about how much time to allow for that journey my hon friend have be an incredibly determined campaigner for this project which run through part of his constituency as he acknowledge we have already meet to discuss the importance of the project to the region and indeed its wide national significance he have write to to reiterate its value to business user include freight and highlight the need to address safety concern which take very seriously as do the secretary of state although the chamber be rather empty this evening be pleased to take the opportunity to thank other right hon and

aspiration for the can assure my hon friend the member for penrith and solway and other that they have convince ministers of the overwhelming local support for this important project rebuild britain mean modernise our transport infrastructure this government will maintain and renew our road network to ensure that it serve all user remain safe and tackle congestion however as my hon friend acknowledge the financial inheritance that this government receive be extremely challenging community up and down the country have be give hope for new transport infrastructure with no plan and no fund to deliver they we will not repeat that mistake this government will rebuild our economic foundation while restore transparency and public trust that be why on july the chancellor of the exchequer announce multi year spending review but let be absolutely clear the project be be consider as part of the second phase which will conclude on june decision on the can not be take separately from that process and whatever have be claim by other local politician can assure my hon friend that the project have not be shelve the spending review will support the development of our new long term strategy for transport develop modern and integrated network with people at its heart within the north of england the link between the at penrith and the at scotch corner be key artery in our strategic road network provide vital east west connection across the pennines it link port on the east coast of england with north west england southern scotland and ferry link to northern ireland the near alternative east west motorway be the which be much far south and look northward the in scotland today the between the and the be approximately mile long and mixture of single and dual carriageway approximately half of the route have already be dualle leave six section of single carriageway to be upgrade national highways note that collision rate on the single carriageway section tend to be high than on the dualle section and tragically number of life have be lose on the route in recent year more than of the vehicle on the route be good vehicle which be approximately twice the average proportion of such vehicle on the strategic road network as whole as my hon friend know the be vital link for people live along the route enable they to reach shop service and employment in nearby town for many live along the route there be no alternative rail connection upgrade the trans pennine would enable traffic to flow more quickly the scheme would make the more viable option for freight operator as they move good across the country aid economic growth as my hon friend note the economic case for the scheme could be improve if high value for the freight value of time be include in the transport analysis guidance we aim to do that in the future but be pleased to be able to assure he that the economic assessment of this project for spend review deliberation include sensitivity test to show the impact of use high value for freight value of time dualle the remain section would make the route more resilient when incident occur as most collision would be confine to one carriageway allow traffic to pass on the other although we would of course prefer that there be no collision at all my final point on the northern trans pennine project be that national highways estimate that the scheme could support the building of thousand of house and the creation of thousand of job as part of growth deal and local plan along the route it could also support carlisle plan st cuthbert garden village an ambitious proposal to provide new home and create economic opportunity until the conclusion of the spending review the interim settlement be the framework for the billion investment for national highways for the current financial year the investment include more than billion for capital enhancement include the northern trans pennine scheme this be one year settlement

review until that conclude the department be not in position to make judgment on individual scheme but can assure my hon friend that my department be commit to put transport at the heart of this mission drive government be determined to ensure that we build the transport infrastructure need to drive economic growth and opportunity in every part of the country include the rural north
